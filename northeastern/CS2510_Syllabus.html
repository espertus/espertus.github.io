        <h1>Course Description</h1>

        <p>
	  Continues CS 2500. Examines object-oriented programming and
	  associated algorithms using more complex data structures as
	  the focus. Discusses nested structures and nonlinear
	  structures including hash tables, trees, and
	  graphs. Emphasizes abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
	  polymorphism, recursion, and object-oriented design
	  patterns. Applies these ideas to sample applications that
	  illustrate the breadth of computer science.

        <p>
          The semester grade for this course will be weighted as
          follows:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Homework: 35%</li>
          <li>Quizzes: 35%</li>
	  <li>Final exam: 20%</li>
	  <li>Lab: 10%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
	  Numeric grades will be converted to letter grades as shown:

        <p></p>

        <p>
          At the time of semester grade determination, numeric grades
          will be rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 94.4 is a
          94). In the unlikely case that a score is exactly between
          two integers, it will be rounded up.
        </p>

        <h2>Homework</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of homework is to give you hands-on experience
          with the course material presented in lecture and lab, since
          the only way to learn is by doing. Unless otherwise stated,
          homework assignments are due every Friday night at 11:59 PM
          Pacific Time.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The lowest homework grade will generally be dropped when
	  computing the semester grade. See the Academic Integrity
	  section for an exception.
        </p>

	<h2>Quizzes</h2>
        <p>
          There will be four quizzes during the semester:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Quiz 1: February 2-3</li>
          <li>Quiz 2: February 23-24</li>
	  <li>Quiz 3: March 16-17</li>
	  <li>Quiz 4: April 6-7</li>
        </ul>
	<p>Quizzes will initially take place during Friday lab times
	but may be moved to Thursday class times if warranted.

        <h2>Final Exam</h2>
        <p>
          The final exam will be given in person on campus during the
          final exam period, April 21-29.
        </p>


        <h2>Lab</h2>
        <p>
	  Lab assignments enable students to practice the concepts
	  presented in class and prepare for homework assignments.
	  They are due at the end of each lab session and are
	  graded on demonstrated effort. The lowest two lab grades are
	  dropped, although it is in students' interest to complete
	  all of them.
        </p>


        <h2>Grading and Feedback</h2>
        <p>
	  We consider fair, prompt, and clear grading to be important,
	  and students are encouraged to contact the appropriate
	  instructor (Ellen for homeworks and quizzes, Rasika for
	  labs) if they do not understand feedback or point
	  removal. Any requests for regrading must be submitted no
	  more than 7 days after the feedback was released.
        </p>

      <div class="school-section">

        <h1>Policies</h1>

        <h2>Attendance</h2>
	<p>
	  Students are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions
	  unless they are unwell, in which case they should stay home
	  and rest, for the safety of themselves and others. Students
	  are advised to have "study buddies" who will share notes
	  with them after absences. Please contact the instructors if
	  you would like help finding a study buddy.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please be in your seat ready to learn when class starts, as
	  arriving late interferes with your and your classmates'
	  learning; however, it is better to arrive late (or leave
	  early) than not to attend class at all.
	</p>

        <h2>Class Participation</h2>
	<p>
	  Students are expected to pay attention and participate in
	  class.  Participation benefits
	  both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/opinion/college-learning-students-success.html?unlocked_article_code=y6ZT9uv809WWRFK36uWvJFL0JiRa7aP83mzM51j_NofhpdmMBrRmvZGoKfW0KNQBJ7MyaPvZp2ul0h5UXNu8sJWeWJC4RDxyz5-5eq3pSGpjv9ZpTHCS13w8f-jAi0YoV5i1WmTIZTesA3HqLB6CS29-XD_25HSy4RrCxMD7UiT002u6FGkeAXPBTFtyXjrGtuoFC1IgDjeRsQxrueNOXrHxx81YmDNOPHRPl5UH-5Ej7xPfoxppesn9gYZj2I_PoTSrQBZOQsHXoUWL_mtvBu6lTkP7a56RTndGquBrqtTpLWN63LCuazyhnWjeXhVmyVDUTta6na-tr5fz_tPFjydUziLkaoUBHcbrZg&smid=share-url">the
	  individual student</a> and their classmates and will enable
	  the instructors to better get to know students so they can
	  more strongly recommend them for co-op and TA positions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  That said, we understand that students have bad
	  days. Students may say "pass" when called on, and the
	  instructor will immediately move onto someone else and not
	  call on the student again that day. The student is, however,
	  expected to later volunteer to answer questions in class
	  when they feel better.
        </p>

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>
	  PDFs of slides will be provided <em>for students to
	  annotate</em>.  They are intentionally incomplete. Students
	  should use software such as Notability (iOS, Mac OS), which
	  Northeastern provided to you, or UPDF (Windows), which has a
	  free version. To get the full benefit of class and be
	  prepared to answer questions when called on, take notes.
	</p>

	<h2>Office Hours</h2>
	<p>
	  Both individual and group office hours will be offered, some
	  of which will be held in person on campus and some online
	  over Teams or Zoom. Because hours may change in response to
	  student need and TA availability, up-to-date information can
	  be found on Canvas.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Students should expect to work a minimum of 2 hours outside
	  of class for every hour of class. Because CS 2510/2511 is a
	  5-hour class, you should expect to spend a minimum of 10
	  hours per week on it. Experienced students may not need as
	  much time early in the semester. Students are encouraged to
	  attend office hours and ask for help on Piazza in order to
	  use their time effectively.
	</p>

        <h2>Late Work</h2>
        <p>
          Falling behind on work is never a good idea: new material is
          presented every day, making catching up harder and harder.
          However, we know that your time is not always easily
          scheduled, and some weeks, "stuff happens."  We will
          therefore allow you to turn in homework up to 48 hours after
          the deadline, with a penalty of 15% per full or partial day.
          Each student gets two free late days, so there is no penalty
          for the first assignment that is up to two days later or the
          first two assignments that are up to one day late. These
          late days will be applied automatically, so you do not need
          to contact the instructor. Additionally, there is a one-hour
          grace period for homework assignments. That means there is
          no penalty for being up to one hour late, but you will be
          docked a day if you are more than one hour late.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Because we do not provide extensions for computer problems,
	  most illnesses, or difficulty understanding instructions,
	  students are encouraged to start assignments early.
        </p>

	<h2>Permitted Resources</h2>

	<p class="emphasis">
	  There are tools and resources that help programmers learn and
	  use their time more effectively. We encourage you to make use of:
	</p>
	<ul class="emphasis">
	  <li>IDEs, such as IntelliJ, and included  tools such as:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html">code completion</a>
	    </li>

	      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/refactoring-source-code.html">refactoring</a>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-optimizing-imports.html">auto-import</a>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-code.html">generation of boilerplate code</a>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <li> web search and websites, especially:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li> the Java API (good search terms are "17" and "API")</li>
	    <li> <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/">Baeldung</a></li>
	    <li> Stack Overflow</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li> your classmates, to clarify what was taught and get ideas of how to approach assignments
	</ul>

	<p class="emphasis">
	  Because it would reduce your learning, you are not allowed to use
	  certain tools (described in the next section) to create code.
	</p>

	<p class="emphasis">
	  You will receive guidance on assignments as to what types of
	  searches are permitted (even encouraged) and what types are
	  disallowed. We also encourage you to ask when unsure.
	</p>

        <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          While students are encouraged to discuss course materials,
          no plagiarism/copying is allowed.  In particular:
        </p>
	<ul>
          <li>You may not copy anyone else's code under any
          circumstances.</li>
          <li>You may not permit any other student to see (or
          otherwise access) any part of your program and you may not
          permit yourself to see (or otherwise access) any part of
          another student's program (unless you are working together
          on an assignment allowing pairing).</li>
          <li>You may not post (or allow someone to post on your
          behalf) a public question that contains any part of your
          code.</li>
	  <li>You may not seek the answer to a problem in a resource
	  not explicitly permitted on the assignment.</li>
	  <li> You may not use automated code generation/modification
	    tools, such as (but not limited to) ChatGPT, Ghostwriter,
	    Copilot, and decompilers <span class="emphasis">to create
	    code</a>. Course staff members will run these and other
	    tools on assignments (including quizzes) to see what they
	    produce.</li>
	  <li> We will use automated tools to
 	  identify similar submissions. While we understand that there
 	  are times students may generate similar code, we will
 	  consider excessive similarities to be evidence toward
	  academic integrity violations.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
	  Additionally, it is never acceptable to share an access
	  code (such as for a Canvas quiz) with another student.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the
	  assignment. It will be up to the
	  instructor whether to allow the zero to be dropped when
	  computing the semester grade.  Second offenses (including
	  offenses from CS 2500) or severe first offenses will lead to
	  failing the course. All offenses will be reported to
	  the <a href="https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/"
	  target="_blank"> Office of Student Conduct and Conflict
	  Resolution (OSCCR)</a> for their records and possible further
	  penalties.</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/"
          target="_blank">university's academic integrity policy</a>
          discusses actions regarded as violations and consequences
          for students.
        </p>

        <p class="emphasis">
	  If you have a question about what is considered a violation
	  of this policy, please ask an instructor.
	</p>

	<p class="emphasis">
	  If you ever feel that cheating is your best option, please
          reach out to an instructor for help.
	</p>


        <h2>Restrictions on course materials</h2>
	<p class="emphasis">
	  We know there are websites like Chegg and Course Hero that
	  encourage students to upload course materials.  Do not
	  upload ours. (Do not upload anybody's course materials
	  without their permission.) Doing so would be considered a
	  violation of the academic integrity policy, as would be
	  making use of information that other students have uploaded.
	</p>


        <h2>Canvas</h2>
	<p>
	  Further information on assignments and resources can be
	  found on Canvas. Students are responsible for completing all
	  work assigned on Canvas and promptly reading announcements
	  posted through Canvas, which is how any changes to this
	  syllabus, due dates, or quiz dates will be announced.
        </p>

	<h2>Changes to the syllabus</h2>
	<p>
	  Changes to the syllabus will be announced through Canvas and
	  can be tracked
	  on <a href="https://github.com/espertus/espertus.github.io/commits/main/northeastern/CS2510_Syllabus.html">github</a>.

        <h1>Classroom Environment</h1>

        <p>
          To create and preserve a classroom atmosphere that optimizes
          teaching and learning, all participants share a
          responsibility in creating a civil and non-disruptive forum
          for the discussion of ideas.  Students are expected to
          conduct themselves at all times in a manner that does not
          disrupt teaching or learning.  Your comments to others
          should be constructive and free from harassing statements.
          You are encouraged to disagree with other students and the
          instructor, but such disagreements need to respectful and be
          based upon facts and documentation (rather than prejudices
          and personalities).  The instructor reserves the right to
          interrupt conversations that deviate from these
          expectations.  Repeated unprofessional or disrespectful
          conduct may result in a lower grade or more severe
          consequences.  Part of the learning process in this course
          is respectful engagement of ideas with others.
        </p>

        <h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
        <p>

	<h2>Title IX</h2>
        <p>
          Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects
          individuals from sex or gender-based discrimination,
          including discrimination based on gender-identity, in
          educational programs and activities that receive federal
          financial assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Northeastern’s Title IX Policy outlines Prohibited Offenses,
          which are defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault,
          relationship or domestic violence, and stalking.  The Title
          IX Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff,
          regardless of gender.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you or someone you know has been a survivor of a
          Prohibited Offense, <span style="font-style:
          italic">confidential</span> support and guidance can be
          found through <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/"
          target="_blank">University Health and Counseling
          Services</a> and
          the <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/"
          target="_blank">Center for Spiritual Dialogue and
          Service</a> clergy members.  By law, those employees are not
          required to report allegations of sex or gender-based
          discrimination to the University.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the
          Title IX Coordinator
          within <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/"
          target="_blank">The Office for Equity and Compliance</a>
          at <a href="mailto:titleix@northeastern.edu"
          target="_blank">titleix@northeastern.edu</a> and/or through
          NUPD (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency 617.373.2121).
          Reporting Prohibited Offenses to NUPD
          does <strong>NOT</strong> commit the victim/affected party
          to future legal action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Faculty members are considered "responsible employees" at
          Northeastern University, meaning they are required to report
          all allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the
          Title IX Coordinator.
        </p>

        <p>
