        <h1>Course Description</h1>



        <p>
          Introduces the fundamental ideas of computing and the principles of programming.
          Discusses a systematic approach to word problems, including analytic reading, synthesis, goal setting, planning, plan execution, and testing.
          Presents several models of computing, starting from nothing more than expression evaluation in the spirit of high school algebra.
          No prior programming experience is assumed; therefore, suitable for freshman students, majors and nonmajors alike who wish to explore the intellectual ideas in the discipline.
        </p>

        <h1>Evaluation</h1>

        <p>
          The semester grade for this course will be weighted as follows:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Homework: 40%</li>
          <li>Quizzes: 30%</li>
	  <li>Final exam: 20%</li>
	  <li>Lab: 10%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your lowest homework grade will not be included in your semester grade.</p>

        <p>
	  Numeric grades will be converted to letter grades as shown:

        <p>
          At the time of semester grade determination, numeric grades will be rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 94.4 is a 94). In the unlikely case that a score is exactly between two integers, it will be rounded up.
        </p>

        <h2>Lab</h2>
        <p>
          Lab sessions meet every Friday and are required. Most weeks there will be a lab assignment, due at the end of the lab session, for you to practice the concepts presented in lecture and prepare for homework assignments.
          The lab assignment is graded on demonstrated effort.
        </p>

	<h2>Office Hours</h2>
	<p>
	  Both individual and group office hours will be offered, some of which will be held in person on campus and some online over Teams or Zoom. Because hours may change in response to student need and TA availability, up-to-date information can be found on Canvas.
	</p>

        <h2>Homework</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of homework is to give you hands-on experience with the course material presented in lecture and lab, since the only way to learn is by doing. Unless otherwise stated, homework assignments are due every Thursday night at 11:59 PM Pacific Time.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Students should expect to work a minimum of 2 hours outside of class for every hour of class. Because CS 2500/2501 is a 5-hour class, you should expect to spend a minimum of 10 hours per week on it. Experienced students may not need as much time early in the semester. Students new to programming are encouraged to attend office hours and ask for help on Piazza in order to use their time effectively.
	</p>

        <h2>Quizzes</h2>
        <p>
          There will be four quizzes during the semester:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Quiz 1: September 30</li>
          <li>Quiz 2: October 14</li>
	  <li>Quiz 3: November 4</li>
	  <li>Quiz 4: November 18</li>
        </ul>
	<p>Quizzes will take place during lab sessions.</p>

        <h2>Final Exam</h2>
        <p>
          The final exam will be given in person on campus during the final exam period:
		<ul>
			<li> Wednesday, December 14, 8-10 AM (morning section)</li>
			<li> Tuesday, December 13, 1-3 PM (afternoon section)</li>
	      </ul>
        </p>

      </div>


      <div class="school-section">

        <h1>Policies</h1>

        <h2>Attendance</h2>
	<p>
	  Students are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions unless they are unwell, in which case they should stay home and rest, for the safety of themselves and others.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please be in your seat ready to learn when class starts, as arriving late interferes with your
	  and your classmates' learning; however, it is better to arrive late (or leave early) than not to
	  attend class at all.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Students are required to complete <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=gcLuqKOqrk2sm5o5i5IV54cEzD6_-qdHvfyamrIZ83dUNUZVTlZXT1oyRkdLMFlPQldCTkFHUU42MC4u" target="_blank">this check-in survey</a> when they are absent from class or leave significantly
	  early or late, so we know whether they are alright and can provide information on how to make up missed
	  material. Students are also advised to have "study buddies" who will share notes with them after absences.
	</p>

        <h2>Late Work</h2>
        <p>
          Falling behind on work is never a good idea: new material is presented every day, making catching up harder and harder.
          However, we know that your time is not always easily scheduled, and some weeks, "stuff happens."
          We will therefore allow you to turn in homework up to 48 hours after the deadline, with a penalty of 15% per full or partial day.
	  Each student gets two free late days, so there is no penalty for the first assignment that is up to two days later or
	  the first two assignments that are up to one day late. These late days will be applied automatically, so you do not need to contact the instructor. Additionally, there is a one-hour grace period for homework assignments. That means there is no penalty for being up to one hour late, but you will be docked a day if you are more than one hour late.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Because we do not provide extensions for computer problems or
	  minor illness, students are encouraged to start assignments early.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading and Feedback</h2>
        <p>
	  We consider fair and clear grading to be important, and students are encouraged to send a private message
	  on the appropriate Piazza channel if they do not understand feedback or point removal. Instructions can
	  be found on the logistics channel on Piazza. Any requests for
	  regrading must be submitted no more than 7 days after the feedback was released.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          While students are encouraged to discuss course materials, no plagiarism/copying is allowed.
          In particular:
        </p>
	<ul>
          <li>You may not copy anyone else's code under any circumstances.</li>
          <li>You may not permit any other student to see (or otherwise access) any part of your program and you may not permit yourself to see (or otherwise access) any part of another student's program (unless you are working together on an assignment allowing pairing).</li>
          <li>You may not post (or allow someone to post on your behalf) a public question that contains any part of your code.</li>
	  <li>You may not seek the answer to a problem in a resource not explicitly permitted on the assignment.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>
	  The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment. Second offenses or severe first offenses
	  will lead to failing the course. All offenses will be reported to the <a href="https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">
	    Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution</a> for their records and possible further penalties.

        <p></p>

        <p>
          If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, please ask!
          The <a href="https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/" target="_blank">university's academic integrity policy</a> discusses actions regarded as violations and consequences for students.
        </p>

        <h2>Restrictions on course materials</h2>
	<p>
	  We know there are websites like Chegg and Course Hero that encourage students to upload course materials.
	  Do not upload ours. (Do not upload anybody's course materials without their permission.)
	  Doing so would be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy.
	</p>

      <div class="school-section">

        <h1>Classroom Environment</h1>


        <p>
          To create and preserve a classroom atmosphere that optimizes teaching and learning, all participants share a responsibility in creating a civil and non-disruptive forum for the discussion of ideas.
          Students are expected to conduct themselves at all times in a manner that does not disrupt teaching or learning.
          Your comments to others should be constructive and free from harassing statements.
          You are encouraged to disagree with other students and the instructor, but such disagreements need to respectful and be based upon facts and documentation (rather than prejudices and personalities).
          The instructor reserves the right to interrupt conversations that deviate from these expectations.
          Repeated unprofessional or disrespectful conduct may result in a lower grade or more severe consequences.
          Part of the learning process in this course is respectful engagement of ideas with others.
        </p>

        <h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Students who have disabilities or other conditions that entitle them to academic services and accommodations are
	  encouraged to reach out to the <a href="https://drc.sites.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Disability Resource Center</a>
	  at 20 Dodge Hall or call (617) 373-2675, <em>whether or not they plan to take advantage of such services</em>,
	  in case it later becomes useful. We want all students to succeed and are happy to provide accommodations. Please
	  request a Professor Notification Letter and testing accommodations as described by the <a href="https://drc.sites.northeastern.edu/registered-students/" target="_blank">Disability Resource Center</a>.
        </p>

	<h2>Student Access Support Services</h2>
	<p>
	  Student Access Support Services (SASS), located in Cowell, provides:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> Advising regarding access needs</li>
	  <li> Support navigationg housing, food security, and medical access</li>
	  <li> Crisis support (e.g., leaves, withdrawals, medical emergenices)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For access needs and accomodations, contact Courtney Gutierrez (<a href="mailto:c.gutierrez@northeastern.edu" target="_blank">c.gutierrez@northeastern.edu)</a>.
	  For crisis support, contact Mayra Arevalo-Agyapong (<a href="mailto:m.arevalo-agyapong@northeastern.edu" target="_blank">m.arevalo-agyapong@northeastern.edu</a>).
	</p>

	<h2>Title IX</h2>
        <p>
          Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects individuals from sex or gender-based discrimination, including discrimination based on gender-identity, in educational programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Northeastern’s Title IX Policy outlines Prohibited Offenses, which are defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship or domestic violence, and stalking.
          The Title IX Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, regardless of gender.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you or someone you know has been a survivor of a Prohibited Offense, <span style="font-style: italic">confidential</span> support and guidance can be found through <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/" target="_blank">University Health and Counseling Services</a> and the <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/" target="_blank">Center for Spiritual Dialogue and Service</a> clergy members.
          By law, those employees are not required to report allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the University.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/" target="_blank">The Office for Equity and Compliance</a> at <a href="mailto:titleix@northeastern.edu" target="_blank">titleix@northeastern.edu</a> and/or through NUPD (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency 617.373.2121).
          Reporting Prohibited Offenses to NUPD does <strong>NOT</strong> commit the victim/affected party to future legal action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Faculty members are considered "responsible employees" at Northeastern University, meaning they are required to report all allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the Title IX Coordinator.
        </p>
