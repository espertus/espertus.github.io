            <p>
                Introduces the fundamental ideas of computing and the principles of programming. 
                Discusses a systematic approach to word problems, including analytic reading, synthesis, goal setting, planning, plan execution, and testing. 
                Presents several models of computing, starting from nothing more than expression evaluation in the spirit of high school algebra. 
                No prior programming experience is assumed; therefore, suitable for freshman students, majors and nonmajors alike who wish to explore the intellectual ideas in the discipline.

            <p>
                At the time of semester grade determination, numeric grades will be rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 94.4 is a 94). In the unlikely case that a score is exactly between two integers, it will be rounded up.
            </p>

            <h2>Lab</h2>
            <p>
                Lab sessions meet every Friday and are required. Most weeks there will be a lab assignment, due at the end of the lab session, for you to practice the concepts presented in lecture and prepare for homework assignments.
                The lab assignment is graded on demonstrated effort.
            </p>

            <h2>Homework</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of homework is to give you hands-on experience with the course material presented in lecture and lab, since the only way to learn is by doing. Unless otherwise stated, homework assignments are due every Thursday night at 11:59 PM. 
            </p>

            <h2>Quizzes</h2>
            <p>
                There will be four quizzes during the semester:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>Quiz 1: September 23-24</li>
                    <li>Quiz 2: October 13-14</li>
		    <li>Quiz 3: November 3-4</li>
		    <li>Quiz 4: November 17-18</li>
                </ul>
            <p></p>

            <p>
                More details will come closer to each exam, but they will be done in class or lab.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Exam</h2>
            <p>
                The final exam will be given in person on campus during the final exam period (Dec. 9-16) at a date to be announced.
            </p>

            <h1>Policies</h1>

            <h2>Attendance</h2>
	    <p>
	        Students are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions unless they are unwell. Students should not
	        attend class if they have a transmissible disease, such as COVID-19, and are requested to take prudent
		precautions to avoid endangering their classmates, instructional staff, or themselves.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        Please be in your seat ready to learn when class starts, as arriving late interferes with your
	        and your classmates' learning; however, it is better to arrive late (or leave early) than not to
		attend class at all.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Students are required to complete <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=gcLuqKOqrk2sm5o5i5IV54cEzD6_-qdHvfyamrIZ83dUNUZVTlZXT1oyRkdLMFlPQldCTkFHUU42MC4u">this check-in survey</a> when they are absent from class or leave significantly 
		early or late, so we know whether they are alright and can provide information on how to make up missed
		material. Students are also advised to have "study buddies" who will share notes with them after absences.
	    </p>
		
            <h2>Late Work</h2>
            <p>
                Falling behind on work is never a good idea: new material is presented every day, making catching up harder and harder. 
                However, we know that your time is not always easily scheduled, and some weeks, "stuff happens." 
                We will therefore allow you to turn in homework up to 48 hours after the deadline, with a penalty of 15% per full or partial day.
		Each student gets two free late days, so there is no penalty for the first assignment that is up to two days later or 
		the first two assignments that are up to one day late. Because we do not provide extensions for computer problems or
		minor illness, students are encouraged to start assignments early.
            </p>

            <h2>Grade Questions</h2>
            <p>
	        We consider fair and clear grading to be important, and students are encouraged to contact graders if they do not
		understand feedback or point removal. Any requests for regrading must be submitted no more than 7 days 
                after the feedback was released.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you have a regrade request you should first reach out to the individual who graded your work. 
                ??
                If the individual is unable to address your concerns you can approach the course instructor for further assistance.
            </p>

            <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                While students are encouraged to discuss course materials, no plagiarism/copying is allowed. 
                In particular:
            </p>
	    <ul>
                <li>You may not copy anyone else's code under any circumstances.</li>
                <li>You may not permit any other student to see (or otherwise access) any part of your program and you may not permit yourself to see (or otherwise access) any part of another student's program (the only exception is if you have been paired by the instruction staff).</li>
                <li>You may not post (or allow someone to post on your behalf) a public question that contains any part of your code.</li>
		<li>You may not seek the answer to a problem in a resource not explicitly permitted on the assignment.</li>
            </ul>
	    <p>
	        The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment. Second offenses or severe first offenses
	        will lead to failing the course. All offenses will be reported to the <a href="https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/">
		Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution</a> for their records and possible further penalties.
	    
            <p></p>

            <p>
                If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, please ask! 
                The <a href="https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/" target="_blank">university's academic integrity policy</a> discusses actions regarded as violations and consequences for students.

            <p>
                To create and preserve a classroom atmosphere that optimizes teaching and learning, all participants share a responsibility in creating a civil and non-disruptive forum for the discussion of ideas.
                Students are expected to conduct themselves at all times in a manner that does not disrupt teaching or learning.
                Your comments to others should be constructive and free from harassing statements.
                You are encouraged to disagree with other students and the instructor, but such disagreements need to respectful and be based upon facts and documentation (rather than prejudices and personalities).
                The instructor reserves the right to interrupt conversations that deviate from these expectations.
                Repeated unprofessional or disrespectful conduct may result in a lower grade or more severe consequences.
                Part of the learning process in this course is respectful engagement of ideas with others.
            </p>

            <h2>Title IX</h2>
            <p style="font-style:italic">
                Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects individuals from sex or gender-based discrimination, including discrimination based on gender-identity, in educational programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Northeastern’s Title IX Policy prohibits Prohibited Offenses, which are defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship or domestic violence, and stalking.
                The Title IX Policy applies to the entire community, including male, female, transgender students, faculty and staff.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you or someone you know has been a survivor of a Prohibited Offense, <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline">confidential</span> support and guidance can be found through <strong>University Health and Counseling Services</strong> staff (<a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/" target="_blank">https://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/</a>) and the <strong>Center for Spiritual Dialogue and Service</strong> clergy members (<a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/" target="_blank">https://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/</a>).
                By law, those employees are not required to report allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the University.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within <strong>The Office for Gender Equity and Compliance</strong> at: <a href="mailto:titleix@northeastern.edu">titleix@northeastern.edu</a> and/or through <strong>NUPD</strong> (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency 617.373.2121).
                Reporting Prohibited Offenses to NUPD does <strong>NOT</strong> commit the victim/affected party to future legal action.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">Faculty members are considered "responsible employees"</span> at Northeastern University, meaning they are required to report all allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the Title IX Coordinator.
