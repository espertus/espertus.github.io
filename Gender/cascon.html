<h2>The Computer Gender Gap I (Wed., Nov. 13, afternoon)</h2>

<p>This workshop aims to facilitate communication among people who wish
to lessen gender barriers in computer science.  Participants will be
expected to be familiar with the literature on women in computer
science and are invited to contribute information about areas that
have not yet been well-studied, such as issues facing women of color
and women not from the United States or Canada.  Participants will
describe existing and proposed programs, with the goal of providing
others with information that can help them lead successful programs.</p>

<h2>The Computer Gender Gap II (Thu., Nov. 14, afternoon)</h2>

<p>This is a continuation of the discussions started in Wednesday
afternoon's session.  There will be a brief summary at the start of
this session followed by discussion on how described programs could be
exported to other institutions or changed to be more effective,
especially in light of the other information presented the previous
day.</p>
