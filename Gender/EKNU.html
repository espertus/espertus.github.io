<h2>Introduction</h2>

Questions of gender and science have come into the foreground in
sociological theory, feminist research and human resource policy.
This chapter focuses on the experiences of women in Ph.D.  programs
and as faculty members. Rather than examining threshold effects that
might keep women out of graduate programs, or glass ceiling effects
that might keep women with high quality training from progressing to
the peak of academic careers we investigated the conditions under
which women are at a disadvantage during their doctoral training and
early stages of their academic careers. Academic practices, presumed
to be meritocratic and gender-free, often work against
 women's professional success. Their deleterious effects on most women
are sometimes hidden behind a neutral or even positive facade erected
on the highly publicized achievements of a few exceptional women, some
of whom deny the existence of obstacles in their path (Science, 1992).
In our discussion we do not mean to imply that men do not have some of
these same experiences as well as different ones. However, the lack of
social and professional connections available to most women in
academic science and engineering departments, in concert with overt
and covert gender bias as well as differences in socialization,
creates special and unique problems for women.<p>

<h2>Data and Methods</h2>


 The initial research site is classified as a Carnegie I research university
(Boyer, 1987). Four science and engineering departments were
selected for examination, including two basic sciences (physics
and chemistry) an engineering discipline  (electrical engineering) and
a hybrid discipline, computer science (at this university located
located jointly in the Engineering
School and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences),
 to determine the receptivity of their cultures to women
graduate students and faculty members.
Three hundred and fifty current students and seventy six dropouts
were identified in the four departments, along with one hundred
and ninety eight students
who received their doctorates within the past five years. 
In these departments there are one hundred and
seventeen faculty members, including five women, two each in computer
science and physics and one in chemistry.  At the time faculty data
were collected only  one of the  women was tenured.
During the course of the study another was granted tenure, she was
apparently the first to be accorded permanent status in the
engineering school.  (The physics department previously had two
tenured women, one now emeritus and the other deceased.)<p>

We  collected data from departmental academic records on advisors and
advisees and
 interviewed female and male faculty members, female graduate
students and academic administrators.
The quantitative data consists of a listing of
current graduate students, along with Ph.D. recipients over the
last five years, paired with their main faculty advisors
(from one of the departments, electrical engineering, data on Ph.D.
recipients only spans the past two years).  Supplementing this, data
were also gathered for students who dropped out of their programs
prior to earning their doctorate.  In the computer science and
physics departments, dropout information was obtained for the
previous five years, while in chemistry it spans three years, and
in electrical engineering only one.  (Since physics
students are not assigned a faculty advisor until after they have
completed two years, advisor data were missing for those who dropped
out of the program before this point.  In electrical engineering,
 dropout data were provided  only for the prior year and
 did not include students who left after failing a
qualifying exam administered after their first few months in the
program.)  <p>


The qualitative data consists of forty six interviews with faculty,
graduate student, and adminstrator informants.  Twenty five interviews
were conducted with female Ph.D. students who were currently attending
or recently graduated within the physics, chemistry, electrical
engineering, and computer science departments.  Interviews were
conducted with all five female faculty members. Two recent former
women faculty members who are currently faculty members at other
universities were also interviewed.  Interviews were conducted with
eight male faculty members who had been identified by chairs or
graduate students as having either particularly good or poor relations
with female graduate students.  Chairs were also interviewed to
ascertain whether there were any special departmental policies
concerning the recruitment of women (there were none).  Interviews
were also conducted with administrators in the engineering and
graduate schools.  Women's experience as faculty members and graduate
students was studied in the same four disciplines at a public research
university. In addition, a department of molecular biology with a
critical mass of women faculty was studied at a third university for a
total of nine departments.  This chapter primarily reports on the
qualitative findings from the initial site.<p>

<h2>Barriers to Entry</h2>

Barriers against professional women have been framed in two different
ways, emphasizing two stages at which obstacles might occur:
a threshold "beyond which gender no longer matters," 
and  a "glass ceiling of gender specific
obstacles to advancement into top positions"  In the first, women encounter
difficulties advancing in a field but the
obstacles fall away once a certain status is attained; in the second
 There is a particular
career level women may attain at which point a blockage occurs to
further advancement, e.g. women are blocked from attaining full
professorship in science departments at leading universities. (Sonnert, 1990)
The "threshold effect" presumes that women only face barrier in the
early stages of their career, while the "glass ceiling" presumes barriers
only at the higher levels of careers.<p>

We find, instead that women face
 barriers to entry and achievement  at all stages of the academic ladder.  We have identified a series of
mechanisms that mitigate against the progress of women 
 in academic careers in science and engineering. 
 First, such extra-academic factors as
 the differential socialization of men and
women and marriage and family. Second, the normal working of everyday
 features of academic science such as
 advising patterns have the
unintended consequence of 
excluding women.  <p>

Thirdly, there are sources of subtle and not-so subtle bias derived
from the taken-for-granted male model of doing science that also
discourage women from full participation. 
Needless to
say,  these characteristics are often intertwined and a phenomenon
discussed in one category of analysis will also overlap into another.
In the following sections we discuss examples of each of these three types of barriers to entry
into scientific careers  and offer suggestions as to how they can
be eliminated or at least lowered.<p>

<h3>Socialization Barriers</h3>

Barriers to women deriving from the structure of the academic system
are reinforced by "cumulative disadvantage" factors that excluded
other women from science but also carry over and affect the academic
careers of women. 
 These include the differential socialization of men and women,
impaired self-confidence, and expectations regarding the impact of
children on women's academic careers.  The roots of this problem lie
in the different gender experiences of boys and girls.  As young girls
and women, females are socialized to seek help and be help givers
rather than to be self-reliant or to function autonomously or competitively, as
are boys.  Girls are encouraged to be good students in-so-far as they
expect to be given a task, complete it well, and then receive a reward
from an authority figure.  In graduate school, behavior is expected to
be independent, strategic and void of interpersonal support.  These
expectations are antithetical to traditional female socialization. In
addition, the needs of women, based on socialization which encourages
supportive interaction with teachers, is frowned upon by many male and
some female faculty as indicative of inability.  As a female graduate
student put it: "The men have the attitude of 'Why should people need
their hands held?'" Lack of a supportive environment exacerbates
problems of an often already low level of self-confidence.<p>




Many women come into graduate programs in science with a low degree
of self-confidence.  Women in physics, chemistry, and computer
science reported that their graduate school experience further eroded
their level of self- confidence.  A female graduate student  
described the following  symptoms:
"Women couch their words with all these
qualifiers [because they are so insecure]...'I'm not sure, but maybe...'"
One female graduate student said:
"I have the symptoms of the insecure woman.  A comment from
a professor can cripple me.  I would be self-deprecating. 
My science is different because of my socialization, not my
gender."
 Another woman reported that:
"Women tend to measure themselves:  'Am I allowed to do
this?  This I know and this I don't know.  This I should be 
     ashamed I don't know."<p>


 If things are working out well, then initial lack of
self-confidence is not too important: but if problems arise, then
negative feelings come forth. For example, one woman had this to say:
"It is much worse if a woman fails
 an exam because her self confidence is so low.  I got an A- on an
exam and was upset.  The man sitting next to me got a C and he said,
'So what?'"  Another woman described the invidious comparisons that
she began to make if things were not going well: 
<blockquote>
If I'm
not feeling good about myself, I start comparing myself to these
brilliant people [highly qualified foreign students].  It doesn't
effect American males as much."
</blockquote>

 Finally, if the barriers remain high low self confidence translates
into an increased rate of attrition.  Such attrition can be viewed as
a result of an accumulative thrwarting of the development of a viable
professional identity.
 Even those who do not give up often reduce their
professional aspirations.<p>

Not surprisingly, low self-confidence in conjunction with lack of a
viable professional identity produces	 reduced aspirations.  A male
faculty member said of his female students: 
<blockquote>Their job
aspirations are so low, their self-confidence is so low, they tend not
to apply for what they see as a very tough place.
</blockquote>


It is no surprise that pregnancy and child-bearing still have negative
consequences for women in the world of work in the United States
(Gerson, 1985). However,
the  impacts appear to be especially strong in academic science, given
its  structural features that mandate virtually exclusive attention to
research achievement during the years that coincide with fertility.
Realization of what lies ahead sometimes deflects women from pursuing
the Ph.D.
A woman engineer speaking to a colloquium at a private research university
organized to encourage women students to pursue engineering careers
advised them to seek jobs in industry after the B.A. She said that once
they were established in their group industry would accommodate part
time work or work at home during childbearing and early child-rearing
years. She  said that she had chosen not to pursue
 a Ph.D. because she wanted to have her children before she
was thirty.<p>

Marriage and children negatively impact women's careers in academic
science at three key times: having a child during graduate
school, marriage at the point of seeking a job, and pregnancy prior
to tenure. In addition, we found some disparagement of marriage
during the graduate student career.
 Women, but not men, are sometimes
thought to be less than serious about their science if they do not
stay single while in graduate school.   As a female graduate student recalled:
<blockquote>
 When I first interviewed to come here, I was single. On my first day
of walking into this department I had an engagement ring on my finger.
[My adviser's] attitude was "families and graduate programs don't go
together very well."  First he was worried I was going to blow my
first year planning my wedding.  I got a lot of flack about that and
so did other women...teasing.  "So and so's not going to get much work
done this semester because she'll be planning her wedding."
[sarcastically] The guys' don't plan weddings.  
</blockquote>
 Earlier in the
century, marriage was grounds for a woman's expected retirement from a
faculty position. The mutual exclusion of academic and family life has
a long history. Until well into the nineteenth century Oxbridge male
academics were also expected to choose between academic career and
marriage. Neveretheless, there have been few if any residual carryovers from
the male academic celibate role. Even when a choice between academic
career and family is no longer an offical requirement, the presumption
that each role requires a woman's total attention  survives. It
next surfaces when children are contemplated or arrive.<p>


Women graduate students expect that they will be penalized for having
children. One informant visualized her advisor's and the department's
reaction: "If I had walked into _____'s office and said I
was pregnant, they would have been happy for me as a woman, but in
their list of priorities as to who to get out of the program and who
to support I would have plummeted to the bottom of the list."
These concerns arise because the existing
 academic structure is ill equipped to deal with pregnancy. 
Pregnancy is discouraged and graduate women who have children are
encouraged to take leaves of absence that tend to become permanent
withdrawals. In one department an informant reported that:
"The only one left is ______[of the students who has a
child].  Two women Ph.D.s who got pregnant were strongly
encouraged to take leaves of absence.  One did and one did not
come back." In
another department a female graduate student reported that: 
<blockquote>
 One person took a leave of absence to get married and
asked her adviser if she had a child would she be able to
work parttime and he told her, 'Absolutely not. No way.' 
What if I should want to do something like that?  Is it the
end of my career in _____?  Was it just the adviser?  What
am I going to do with my life?  People say they're not going
to have children until they're 40 and have tenure.  I can't
think like that.  Thinking about [these] details is what
scares me.  That's when I think I should drop out.
</blockquote>

Graduate student women were caught in a bind, wanting to have
children and, while doing so, wanting to show that they could keep up
with the pace of graduate work. A female faculty member reported that:
<blockquote>
I had one student who was having her child in the middle of
the semester and was to take and pass her qualifiers at the end of the
semester.  She wanted to do it.  I said, 'don't do it'...because of
the emotional state you are in and the physical state after having a
baby.  We discussed this at length at one of our meetings...she ended
up not doing it.
</blockquote>

One department had taken childbearing into account to a limited extent:
<blockquote>
During evaluations, If a Ph.D. [student] has a child she
will be given some leeway for that semester...  I think that's
pretty funny...it's such a small amount of time.  I think the women
should get more leeway, you're physically out of it.  It should be
longer...at least a year.  What's the big deal.  [In one case, a student]...
had the baby in November and had until the end of the semester.  It
was partly her fault as well; she did not want to say she could do
less.  The faculty gave her a choice of doing a part time thing or
keeping up to pace.  She chose to be put to the same standard as
everyone else.
</blockquote>

A peer had a somewhat different view of the faculty's action and
described an unusual instance of  solidarity among women graduate students:
<blockquote>
She decided not to take a leave [when she had the child]
and made the decision at the end of the semester when we are
all evaluated.  She got a particularly harsh letter, [the faculty]
essentially threatened to cut her support.  They gave her
requirements that would not be achievable for anybody...even
without a baby.  Two people had left the department earlier
in the semester.  One was a new mother, the other was a man
who was very involved with his family.  We got the feeling
this was being done to discourage her and tell her to go
away.  She was encouraged by her husband and a number of us
to renegotiate this because it was clearly off base and came
out of the blue.
</blockquote>

The expectation that women students will succumb to the pressures of
child bearing and child rearing makes some male and female faculty
wary of taking on women students in the first place especially since
funding is tight and every place must be made to count.  Another
female faculty member stated that, 
<blockquote>
If a student had a baby
with her, I wouldn't have her.  Students who have babies here get no
work done.  It's not that I wouldn't take a woman with a child in the
first place, but the first sign of trouble, I would just tell them to
go away.  If my students fail it looks bad for me.
</blockquote>
 Women who survive
the strain of lack of support for childbearing and childrearing in
academia and complete their degrees at the highest levels of
achievement may nevertheless find that their career will not survive
the next hurdle of the academic career path. Two shifts in work site:
from Ph.D. program to post-doctoral position in a different university
and from post-doc to yet another work-site. The highest
climbers on the academic ladder of success are able to accept the most
promising and prestigious post-doctoral and faculty positions without
regard to any other consideration. The rule of intellectual exogamy
has disastrous career consequences for  women who are unable or
unwilling to make individualistic locational decisions. As one
observer put it: "The academic market is a national one. Those who do
not accommodate their choice of geographical location and willingness
to move to their careers may lose out"(Rosenfeld, 1984: 99).<p>

The next impediment is at the point of the job search.
When 
 a married woman is about to attain  the Ph.D., the 'two body' problem 
comes into play, typically deflecting women's careers from their
highest potential. <p>

Marriage and children are generally viewed by male faculty members as
impediments to a scientific career for women. Even those most
supportive of women note that 
<blockquote>
I've had some
disappointments with very good women who settled for jobs that are less
than an equivalent man would do. You have some extremely good people
you think are going to go out and make a mark and then somehow or
other they marry somebody and spend their time in a bad career.  For
a man to decide not to take his career seriously is like admitting he
takes drugs.  For a woman to say she puts her family ahead of her
career is considred a virtue; the pressures are all in that
direction.  The women are told, 'Isn't this wonderful. You are giving
up your career to sacrifice for your husband.' The pressures come from
society, relatives, to some extent the men involved, the parents of the
husband.
</blockquote>

On the other hand, a few women take a different tack. They
are willing to break off personal relationships that
interfere with accepting the best possible job. A male professor
portrayed the situation of a woman, involved with a man, whom he said,
<blockquote>
...could have gone either way. I asked
her, 'To what extent is his career going to interact with what you do?'
She said, 'Not at all. I want to find the best job I can and if it
works out for him O.K. and if it doesn't well then that's the end of
the relationship.' So she had decided that career is
what really mattered. She's at [prestigious Eastern university] and he's still
 out in California so that's the end of him. 
 She took what I would say is a typically man's approach to
things, that the career is the primary decision but they don't all do
that.
</blockquote>


Universities are seldom eager to hire both husband and wife in the
same department. The departmental work site
tends to become a place where graduate students find marriage
partners, disciplinary endogamy is not reflected in hiring practices.
At the time of the study, a search for chair was underway at one
department in our sample. The leading candidate's wife was also
seeking a position at a junior level.  Even though she was regarded as
eminently qualified for a line that was available in her area and the
administration was willing to aprove both hirings, faculty members
objections to bringing in both husband and wife overrode all other
considerations. Whenever one set of specific objections were taken
into account such as removing the chair from oversight of review
decisions concerning his wife by sending them directly to the dean,
new objections would be raised. The departmental culture was resistant
to accommodating a dual career-family. Department members believed
that a married couple would bring a heightened level of personal
relationships into the department and that this would be 
inevitably disruptive, beyond the usual friendship patterns and
cliques of academic life. <p>



 Given the
 presumption of geographical mobility as a prerequisite for academic
mobility women's careers  typically suffer disadvantages. Of course, there are
(rather than logical reasons) only cultural reasons why the norm differentially
impacts males and females. The requirements of intellectual exogamy
illustrate how the genderization of society affects science and how
presumed neutral requirements have a male bias built in. As more men
are married to women whose careers are important to them male
geographical mobility will also be affected. As both men and women face
geographical constraints on their job choices it can be predicted that
the link between career success and ability to change work site will
be weakened. Departments that made exceptions and hired their own
female graduates provided a signficant and at times essential career
boost for women who otherwise might have been shunted aside from
research careers in academia due to  locational constraint.<p>

A faculty member's tenure review has caused an added measure of
anxiety. She said: " When it comes to the real facts that's
when you feel discrimination.  The pregnancy worries me.  It's the
wrong moment, always, the wrong moment.  It puts you on a slower
track.  Maybe they do see it like that.  Maybe I've ruined my
chances.  They want you to sacrifice something.  If the baby hadn't
shown up, I would have pushed for an early decision.  Now I will
wait." Even under the best of circumstances the academic structure is
resistant to accommodating family needs. A female faculty member in
one department was able to arrange a modest reduced percentage of
official time commitment involving a reduced teaching load.
She 
 reported that in her department:
"The faculty have been very supportive of me having
children.  After my review I've had people say, 'How can you do that and
have children too?'"  This professor
 adopted the strategy of reducing her work load and lengthening
the time period before the tenure decision. She said that:
<blockquote>
The university policy allows you to work
part-time to have children...that part-time work stops the tenure
clock for the percentage of time you are not working. Because of
tenure, I didn't want to cut my [research] back by 50%, so I made an
arrangement to work 70% and cut the teaching load.  
Everybody assumed, including the chair that this time off
would not count for tenure.  A year before I was supposed
to come up for tenure the chairman brought it up to the provost
because [it was found that] the clock was still running.
If it had stopped, I should have had an extra year before I was up for
tenure so I would have more time to publish and get my research done.
I decided not to fight it because I was concerned how going through a
fight would affect the tenure decision.  I was quite worried when the
case went before the engineering school who are all older men who were
all looking at me not having worked full time.
</blockquote>
In this instance,  the outcome was favorable but the anxiety level,
normally high about tenure prospects,  had
been raised even further by the difficulties that the academic
structure had in recognizing the presence of children in her life.
A few years later she was involved in an effort in the Senate of her
university to make reduction in work load for women with children an
official option. Some of the participants in the debate on the
issue suggested  that it should be among a list of limited choices in fringe
benefits or that it should be equally available to men and that therefore it was too costly to be
made available at all, suggests that the academic system is still 
resistant to accommodating women's needs.<p>


<h3>Academic Advising</h3>

In graduate school, students are expected to develop a close working
relationship with their faculty advisor, a relationship that lasts
several years and is crucial to the progress of the student through
the program and out into the professional world.  Previous
researchers have identified negative interactional
  patterns in male advisors relationships with their female graduate
students that "...lessens their opportunity for advancement (Fox,
1988: 226). We also found a series of gender-related blockages to
successful advisement. At best, there was an attempt at equal
treatment based upon the faulty assumption that women had been
socialized and educated the same as men.  At worst, women graduate
students were sterotyped as less capable and uncompetitive and were
viewed as non-scientists. Such advisors simply could not take women
seriously as graduate students.<p>

 Male faculty can exacerbate or mitigate the effects of
traditional female socialization, depending upon their awareness,
sensitivity and political stance on sex roles.  There are two types of
men in science with respect to women: (1)
 those who follow the male model; with
negative consequences for women; and (2)
those who are aware of the deleterious effect of the male model on
women and who attempt to avert its worst consequences for their female
advisees.<p>

Female experiences with male advisors range from
 denigrative to supportive. On the negative side are interactions that
leave women with doubt about their self-worth. Even though this
advisor probably thought that he was allaying concerns, the effect was
the reverse. "He said to me, 'you don't have anything to
worry about, they want women; so you'll pass [the qualifying exams].'  You
have the feeling, 'Am I here because I'm a woman or because I am
qualified?  It's like they take away all your achievements."
Women also discussed specific negative incidents of gender related
presumptions of lack of scientific
ability. For example,
 [A female student]
was talking to a professor about her problems and he said she was an
'emotional female'. "I couldn't believe
he was thinking that.  Maybe he was thinking I shouldn't be in
physics.  I always thought he was a nice guy.  That's when I feel it:
I'm out there on my own."<p>

 Attempts to find an
analogy to the  traditional female role for women in the laboratory
are in accord with the thesis that academia is a "male milieu" in which women's
presence is viewed as disruptive and threatening. These
 "degradation ceremonies" may  be followed up by
 subtle and not so subtle attempts to
eliminate the unwanted presence. For example, one woman commented:
" When I was trying to get something to work, [my advisor] would come 
up to me and say, 'Did you see it yet?  
Everyday he would say, 'did you see it?'  I should have 
stopped it, but sometimes it takes a long time to see what's
going on.  It was very humiliating."
It is not only male advisors treatment of female students that
affects their situation but also how male advisors instruct their
male students to act toward women. A female graduate student said
that: "I hear rumors about myself...being involved with
somebody. [I heard that] a faculty member was advising his students
that it might be interesting to have an affair with me."<p>

These frequent negative instances
 are complemented by occassions where
men have served as successful advisors to women.
A sensitive male adviser helped a student make future
decisions based on the reality of being a woman within the field:

<blockquote>
His attitude toward women is very understanding, very
supportive, without being condescending.  He doesn't say
"I understand what's going on," which is offensive because
it's hard for a man to understand what's going on.  He
doesn't bring these issues up, I bring them up.  He is very
politically aware.  He'll say, "Don't talk to ____."
 Sometimes [his advice] was because of sexism
and sometimes because this person was an arrogant son of a
bitch and sometimes because this is a good person, but is
just not comfortable with women.
</blockquote>


 Women report that the
best advisers are encouraging, give you concrete directions and show
them the ropes. Women's relative lack of knowledge of how to negotiate the
academic system was called attention to by a woman
faculty member who explained that
many women lacked a strategy to deal with the admissions process:
<blockquote>
What you're supposed to do is get a hold of the brochure
and if you want to get in at least say that's what you want.  The
women don't seem to have grasped that...the men go down the list and
say, I want to work with this professor for this reason, that
professor for that reason...the females give me no indication that
they have even looked at the brochure.
</blockquote>

Without an adviser who is willing to encourage and be directive,
women are often unable to puzzle out the strategies necessary to get
through graduate school.  Most women are not socialized to understand
the  political strategies necessary to advance within the academic
system.  These and other culture
conflicts result in the discouragement of many women graduate students
and young faculty members from pursuing careers at the highest
academic levels.<p>


<h3>Career Choice</h3>

What is the response of women to the strictures of academic life?  A
majority of women graduate students in all departments studied
reported that they intended to pursue an industrial rather than an
academic career since it was more compatible with family life. As an
informant, comparing the two scenes, concluded: 
<blockquote>
Women
will go in to industry.  It's 9 to 5.  It's more flexible.  They have
daycare and childcare.  There are federal rules they have to abide by
in terms of maternity leave whereas in academics you're on your own,
and where there are rules to protect you, you are not protected by
your peers who are saying, 'She hasn't been here in six months,
she's not current with the literature.' The support systems exist [in
industry] and it's the only way you can [have a family].
</blockquote>


Of those who aspired to academia, most were interested in jobs in
small teaching colleges rather than research universities because, as
one woman summed it up: "Science isn't everything." In
recent years two
 women had resigned their positions to take appointments at teaching
colleges where they felt that they could be respected as individuals
and not have to confront a discriminatory environment. <p>



As part of the cumulative thwarting of a female professional identity, 
devaluation of women's scientific contributions has been found to be
widespread (Benjamin, 1991). It takes many forms, including crediting
the male partner in scientific collaborations and ignoring the work of
women (Scott, 1990). At our primary research site, despite a formal
and even at times a strongly stated commitment to non-discrminatory
treatment of women, discrimination was manifested informally.  For
example, a female graduate student reported differential treatment of
men's and women's contributions. She said: "In group meetings I get
the sense that if a woman says something, "okay fine" and that's the
end of that.]<p>

Sometimes, women are devalued by not being included in events. A
female graduate student reported that invisibility was imposed when
"you have a visitor to the lab, the professor introduces the male
students, but does not you."  Another reported self-imposed
invisibility in reaction to expectations that her contributions would
not be valued: 
<blockquote>
[In lab meetings] you feel very self
conscious saying what you think and I think it's because you are a
woman.  They would just as soon you would sit back and be quiet and
when they ask you if it turned red or green, [you say] 'it turned
red,' rather than saying 'it turned red and this is what we're going
to do next.'
</blockquote>


Women found it difficult to be taken seriously as professionals
outside the department as well.  One said that: "If I go to
conferences, if I ask a question, the answer gets addressed to a man
in the room.  It's worse in physics than in other fields." A female
graduate student reported her response to being ignored: "It's always
a thing where being invisible, you don't exist...It was in a sense, I
didnt exist." Other times, women are made to feel different by being
given excessive visibility. A female graduate student reported that a
professor was: "... addressing the class, 'Gentlemen'...and then made
a big pause and looked at me and added, 'and lady.'  I was different.
Other people noticed it..." Still other times women are patronized. A
female graduate student told how: "I was sitting at this table and he
kept referring to us as 'my girls.'  In that context I didn't like it.
He was thinking of us differently.  He didn't say, 'my boys.'"
At the public university, many graduate women felt that they were
treated as"one of the boys" but this was an unsatisfactory resolution,
as well, since differences between men and women with respect to child
bearing were not taken into account.<p>

<h2>"Instrumentals" and "Balancers"</h2>


Essentially women are expected to follow a "male model" of academic
success involving a total time commitment to scientific work and
aggressive competitive relations with peers. There are two contrasting
"ideal typical" responses to this situation by women graduate students
and faculty members.  We have identified two types of responses by
women scientists to gender issues: (1) women who follow the male model
and expect other women to do so, too; and (2) those who attempt to delineate an alternative model, allowing for a
balance between work and private spheres.<p>

Relatively few women are willing to adapt to the male model of
academic science, which involves an aggressive, competitive stance and
an unconditional devotion to work, at least until tenure. We call
these female scientists "instrumentals." Instead, most attempt to
define a women's academic model, balancing work and non-work roles,
with an emphasis by faculty members on cooperation at the work-site
among members of their research group (Kemelgor, 1989).  These women
are the "balancers." Women faculty in a department seldom constitute a
homogeneous group. Instrumentals may even act more negatively and be
less sensitive to female students than male faculty members who are
aware of women's issues. The presence of several women in a department
faculty may not, in itself, be sufficient to overcome barriers to
female students and will not even provide many of them with relevant
role models if they are primarily instrumentals. Nevertheless, the
"critical mass" thesis of several women on the faculty of a science
deparment remains to be seriously tested, especially in departments in
the physical sciences and engineering that likely have no senior women
and may  even have no women on their faculty. Even when "instrumentals" and
"balancers" are at odds with each other, these contrasting  models at
least provide women students with a range of
possibilities  to choose among to integrate into their own stance.<p>




Instrumentals
 are able to act independently and strategically. A female faculty
member described her strategy for getting through graduate school:
"When I went to grad school I specifically chose the chair
as my adviser because I wanted to graduate...He had a reputation for
graduating all his students.  I knew I was doing well when I picked
that guy.  [His research area] didn't matter so much.  The research I
wanted to do, I could do after I graduated. )
Instrumentals typically viewed the system as favorable to women and
regard the status of women as a non-issue. A female
graduate student who believed in doing "the politically right thing"  said:
"When you get to graduate school [physics is] incredibly
biased in favor of women.  They work much harder to keep the
female students and there is good reason.  Most of them
don't come in with adequate preparation.  There are women
who talk themselves out of taking the qualifying exams."
This individual was outwardly hostile toward women, favoring
the men whom she emulated:
"I worked all through my undergraduate career all by myself.
I don't see the need to work with others. The women don't have enough
intelligence to work things out for themselves."<p>

However, she
 also noted the debilitating effects of
traditional socialization on women: "The guys have more of
an idea about mechanical things and are selfconfident.  Women end up
getting help, and then they end up in graduate schools they wouldn't
normally get into and they're stuck because it is built into them to
get help, assistance.<p>

Instrumentals were willing to put in night
and weekend work hours, making the lab the center of their social as
well as work life. One such woman faculty member said: "It
never occurs to the males that they could come in at 9 and leave at 5,
five days a week and get a Ph.D.  They're here at 3 a.m., weekends.
You never see a woman here off hours. You see all the males. the males
are socialized that they have to do their work and it always pissed me
off because I always worked as hard as the men and so did the women
who went to school when I did."<p>

Instrumentals were typically unmarried or divorced and without
responsibilites for child rearing. An informant noted that:
"A common pattern is that women who are successful are
single or divorced and really dedicate most of their energy to their
career."
They are often ambivalent toward women students who are not
as directed as they are. A female faculty member said:
"Males come to me immediately with a problem.  Women muddle
off.  I try cajoling them, pleading with them, yelling at them. I
would rather have men...I guess I don't really mean that."<p>

In contrast to the instrumentals, who emulate the male model,
balancers  find the highly competitive nature of academic science to
be problematic since it conflicts with their own preference for
cooperation as described by this student:
"Given the competitiveness that goes on around here, it is a
lot harder to be open, honest, and supportive because you don't know if
you are going to get turned on."
Balancers are aware of their difficulties in functioning
strategically.
Anxiety and confusion over the desire to balance multiple roles
 overwhelmes students sometimes<p>


The current constrained funding climate 
 exacerbates women's unstable
position,  causing faculty who are fearful of productivity losses, to be
less willing to tolerate deviation from the traditional male model of
doing science.
Despite these obstacles, a new scientific work role is
emerging as women and men struggle to restructure traditional family
and work roles (Gerson, 1985).  To treat the lab strictly as a work
site is a necessary strategy for women (and some men) who want both to
be highly productive as scientists yet maintain an outside life. These
faculty members had a commitment to raising children and interacting
with their family that was  equal in importance to their work
commitment.  <p>

The balancers wished to pursue muliple roles, typically family and
work, seeking a reasonable division between the two spheres. They
organized their laboratories on a collegial, noncompetitive basis and
tried to keep close to normal business hours, resuming intellectual
work at home after their children were asleep.  Balancers also adopted a
non-hovering management style that allowed their students considerable
leeway and initiative in order to keep their scientific life from
becoming an all-consuming activity.  Despite this effort to develop an
organizational style that delimited work from personal life, some
female students felt that their mentors were not spending enough time
with their children and questioned whether they would be willing to
make such a choice in order to pursue a high-powered academic career.<p>


 Perhaps ironically, multiple roles have
recently become accepted for high-status males in science who wish to
combine participation in entrepreneurial ventures with the
professorial role (Etzkowitz, 1989). However, combining the professorial
role with serious attention to family obligations is seldom an
acceptable stance for a high level career in academic science or other
professions (Fox and Biber, 1984). 
Informal activities outside of the department are also often linked to
traditional sex role activities and venues. In one department in a
related study, a regular pick-up basketball game was a site
for exchange of informal comments on research activities along with
visits to a male-oriented local bar. Inevitably a female faculty member felt
 excluded from "the club" (Kemelgor, 1989).<p>


 Some women were able to
work out an accomodation with the demands of a career at a research
university by strictly budgeting their work time and making every
minute of it count. For these women the university was solely a work site,
not combining with it a social environment.
For many males the time put in in the lab is not all work related, but
being in the lab extremely long hours is part of the accepted persona
of the successful academic scientist.  A single male professor in a
related study (Etzkowitz, 1988)
reported that: 
<blockquote>
A lab, in a sense, is a little bit like a
country club. You have your friends here... I don't stay here because
it's competitive. I stay here because who wants to go home? It's
what I see most of the people here doing, too. They get the
newspapers, they talk to their friends, this is the place. It's a
club.
</blockquote>
 Despite recognition of the non-work related
nature of some of this presence on the job, in the culture of
academic science, time spent in the lab is still viewed as an
independent indicator of strength of commitment to science.<p>



 The balancing stance is not solely a female response to academia.
Some male faculty adopted this position to a limited extent but
typically admitted that their participation in domestic life and
child rearing was less than their spouse's. Moreover, not all women
who wished to balance the demands of an academic research career and
family were able to achieve this goal. Graduate students who were
encouraged to take leaves after a pregnancy often did not return.
Ph.D's interested in academic research careers often decided to
accept industry positions either to give their husband first
preference in a job search or to have a work role that was
explicitly limited to a 9-to-5 commitment. Some junior faculty
members abandoned research careers to accept positions in teaching
colleges. Thus, at present, the strategy of balancing career and
family is contrary to the culture of high-status research
universities and is difficult to arrange and sustain. Neverthless,
this is the option that most women in our sample wished to pursue. Few
had the support of their institutions  or persons available whose
example they could follow.<p>


Role modelling has been identified as an effective socialization
process in work life.  Modelling oneself on an older person has been
found to be a good way of creating a pathway into a career,
making for likely early success.  A younger person can take on the
characteristics of an older person in a professional role while
serving in a junior capacity.
  The closer the modeler is to the person modeled, the easier
is it for the transformation process to occur. Conversely, the more
differences that exist, whether in the behavior directly being modeled
or in associated personal characteristics, the more difficult it is
for the socialization process to work. 
Previous research has indentified the characteristics of successful women role models who integrated, "... professional and personal
concerns" (Mokros et.al, 1981: 11). Beyond strictly professional issues
women mentees are  concerned with the interpersonal quality of the
relationship and seek a sympathetic mentor (Dowdall, 1979).<p>

In the sciences, male senior researchers have traditionally served as
role models for their junior colleagues. As women entered scientific
careers they were expected to follow a male model, accept a distinctly
subordinate status (the scientific equivalent of the traditional
female role, the research associate), or leave the profession.  More
recently, some women have attempted to carve out a new status and a
new professional identity for themselves in the world of academic
science (Kemelgor, 1989). This involves a different relationship to
work and students in which work life is pared down to professional
elements and limited in time so that a private life may be
constructed and compartmentalized apart from the professional role.
This is not dissimilar from a 9-5 job with little carryover from work
to home and vice-versa in terms of socializing, professional
relationship and affect.  Indeed it represents a formalization of the
work role and an attempt to remove sexualizing and other personal
elements that may interfere with work.<p>



Women graduate students prefer to have a range of
models of female behaviors in science available to emulate.  At
present, the numbers of female faculty are so small that there are
often few or even no choices of role models.
 A junior female faculty member described her role model
in graduate school: "Another woman did quite well. [There were] many
things I didn't like about her, but it showed it was possible.  There
were a number of women in my field who were well known as I was
going through, most of them were single and remained single."<p>

 Most women graduate students made a sharp distinction between women
faculty whom they viewed as relevant or irrelevant as role models.
Women faculty who were perceived to be instrumentals, emulating an aggressive male
scientist role and attempting to become 'one of the boys,' were often not
viewed as viable models. As a female graduate student said:
" There are no real good role models
to follow.  The women a generation ahead of us had it so
difficult that they are by and large a very aggressive
group.  [They had to be so aggressive] and that's who got
ahead.  You have trouble looking at them and saying, 'I want
to be like that.'  You don't."<p>

 On the other hand, a woman faculty member who was
successfully balancing career and family was looked to as a model by
several women in her department,
even though she was somewhat less available due to time constraints.
A female graduate student said that:
"[She] is a role model precisely because she can balance
the two.  She definitely finds time for the things on both
sides.  It can be hard on her students.  When you do find
the time to finally meet with her, you do have her
attention.  Everyone feels the same way:  Frustrated that
it's tough to get her, but that they really have her when
they do."<p>

However, for most female students anxiety about the present and the
future is exacerbated because there is no model to demonstrate how to
deal with problems or issues. "Women are dropping out
because there are no role models to show you how 'you get there.'"  This
is related to the ability of men to identify culturally with male
advisers and enhance their self-confidence, leaving women with no
one to "pave the way." The need for women faculty to show  how
professional and family responsibilites could both be met was
expressed by a student who said: "I think it would be
interesting to see [the female professor] get pregnant, so we could
see how someone else deals with the situation.  I have no clue
whatsoever.  I don't know what it's like in academics.  I'm scared
about that."
  Thus, for the most part,
students are left to feel they must be pioneers.  In some instances
this situation was resented.  The few who felt they did have role
models, identified them as being from high school, undergraduate
school, or industry, --or they were their mothers.<p>

Most importantly, the role model women wanted was the woman who
could concretely explain the necessary strategies and steps to be
taken to succeed in graduate school.  This conclusion  derives from the reality
that: (1) rules are made by men, (2) young men are socialized to
those rules and further socialized in graduate school.  They have
learned the strategies, (3) most women have not been socialized to be
autonomous, and therefore they have difficulty figuring out
the rules; and (4) most male advisors
do not teach women the strategies
necessary to succeed.<p>

Of course, this finding does not hold for those very few graduate
women who excluded other interests in favor of their career.  The
absence of viable female role models in most of the departments
studied creates anxiety among women graduate students and is believed
by them to contribute to the rate of attrition.  Nevertheless, women
graduate students report successful and unsuccessful experiences with
both men and women advisors. Men can be sensitive advisors and women
can be relevant role models but few men and women faculty currently
meet the needs of most women graduate students.   (22% of the
female students in the four departments at private research
university, as against only 4% of the male students, have female
faculty advisors. While the proportion of female and male students
entering subfields where female faculty advisors are available is
fairly similar (32% and 24%, respectively), the proportion actually
signing up with those female professors differs by a factor of four
(68% to 17%).) Women graduate students seek out women faculty members
as advisors in hopes of finding a sympathetic mentor,  while male
graduate students sign up with a woman only after she has achieved a
distinguished position in the field.<p>

<h2>Policy Implications</h2>

 Some take the current low rate of womens particpation as an accurate
reflection of the number of women with the ability to contribute to
science. We find that the organization and culture of academic science
deters many women of high scientific ability from making their
contribution. In those instances where a department faced up to this
situation and altered its behavior, womens participation improved
dramatically.  A broader recognition of the need to change and
requisite actions are required to reconstruct  male-gendered
science and engineering departments. (Indeed, the experience of
In-balance Program at Center for Particle Astrophysics, University of
Califronia, Berkeley is that many of these changes are necessary for
both women and men.)  From our analysis of the experience of women
graduate students and faculty in the sciences and engineering, we make
the following recommendations to open up academic science to womens
full participation:
<ul>
<li> acceptance of a female model of doing science in a
collegial workplace accompanied by time for a private sphere of life apart from
science;

<li> synchronizing the biological and tenure clocks by allowing a longer
time span before tenure;

<li> rescinding  exogamy requirements for career advancement thereby reducing the negative effects of limits on geographical mobility;

<li> provision of a signficant number of relevant role models so that
younger women can envision a future in science.
</ul>



With regard to institutional culture, it is clear that
administrative actions, engendered from above or below, even if they
do not change attitudes,  can affect behavior. A female graduate dean at
another university reported on the efficacy at her institution of
administrative leadership
 to remind people of gender and minority issues at every
step of the academic process. "We had a graduate program director who
took this issue up as a personal cause."
She reported that it was most important to be
stringent on sexual harassment so that
eveyone knew that it is morally and legally wrong, officially and
unofficially.<p>

The affirmative action officer at the primary research site, a female
attorney, reported that she received virtually no complaints from
women in the science and engineering departments, while there were many
from the humanities and social sciences. She presumed that the
universalistic spirit of science, rather than an environment that suppresses the expression
of gender differences, was responsible for the paucity of
complaints . In one instance a woman graduate student
contemplated making a complaint against a male faculty member who was
discussing porngraphic images  on a computer screen with his male
graduate student. The incident took place in her presence in an office
that she shared with the graduate student.  She drew back from making
an official complaint, fearful of endangering her degree. However, the
matter attained sufficient visibility within the department that the
chair sent out a strongly worded message condemning the practice as
unnacceptable and warning against its repetition.<p>



One department studied  had undergone significant
 change with respect to its treatment of women. Among its leaders were
several middle-aged males who
had simultaneously been in therapy in a community where the local
culture had been strongly influenced by feminist values. In this
context,  one of
them pointed out to the others that they were being unconsciously
dismissive of the work of a female faculty member up for tenure. They
accepted the validity of the charge, reviewed their behavior, and
decided to change their attitudes and practices. (In another
instance the
change did not come voluntarily but only after a female faculty
member threatened to resign when a sexist male faculty member was about to
be named permanent chair. This action received nationwide publicity, forcing university officials to do something about  the sexist
environment of the department. They
prescribed a year of gender sensitivity training for the acting chair
who resigned the position. See <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>
April 1, 1992 p. A 14.) They also revised the
departmental structure to emphasize collegiality and gender-blind
decision making.  For example, graduate student admission decisions
are made by a
 committee with equal representation of faculty and students. Two
students are elected each year to review and interview applicants. A
male and a female had served in the previous year and two females in
the current year. Applicants stay with other students when they come
to campus to be interviewed. Once the incoming class has been picked,
the incoming students are invited to a social event involving the entire department,
with a picnic and other activities. <p>

All women students and faculty interviewed reported that they joined
it rather than a department at an other prestigious institution,
because of their perception that it offered a collaborative,
cooperative, and collegial milieu.  They were attracted by the warm
interpersonal interactions they had experienced when they interviewed
and by a sense of personal concern for the candidate conveyed by
faculty and students. They were also impressed by the sense of
well-being members of the department displayed. Most had been disturbed by
the demoralization of students at other departments where they had
interviewed, having heard stories of exploitative advisors and
anonymity in large research groups. <p>

Since almost all of these students had previously
worked in laboratories as undergraduates or as technicians in academia
or industry, they had a clear idea of the laboratory evironment that
they wished to find as well as what thay wanted to avoid. Several had
suffered isolation in sexist, autocratically run, competitive
laboratories in which their status as female technicians promoted
loneliness and professional stagnation. They had relocated to
laboratories in which laboratory heads and post-doctoral fellows had
enhanced their self-confidence by direct teaching, generosity in allowing
time for communication, and responding to questions without derison. In
each of these instances, the informant came away feeling capable and
competent to undertake graduate work having experienced empathy and
understanding from a mentor figure, whether female or male.<p>

While the science being done in the department or by a faculty member
often initiated a candidates interest in the school; the emotional
gratification of the interview process together with a preference for
a collegial research environment, influenced the candidates final
decision.  Thus, selecting this particular department was a means of
recapturing a significant professional and personal growth experience that
had promoted self-confidence and emergence of a scientific
self-identity.  In this department a female academic model based on
interpersonal relationships, affiliation and nurturance had become
acccepted as legitimate and had even become the departmental norm.
This was in strong contrast to another research site, where the
expression by women of a need for these characteristics in the
laboratory environment was derided as a desire for dependence and
emotionality by the adherents of the patriarchal system that was in
place.<p>

The key to mentoring women is not whether the mentors are women or
men, but whether they are able to relate to women. Women professors
who follow the male model, in fact, often heighten performance anxiety
among their female students by expecting more of themselves and their
women students than do males.  Patriarchal institutional roles,
whether enacted by men or women, result in female behaviors and
preferences being misinterpreted, for example, preference for a
collegial rather than a competitive working environment, as inferior
rather than different.  Moreover, most women students reject an
academic lifestyle that excludes non-scientific relationships and
activities, including childrearing.<p>



That the seven year race for tenure with the biological clock for
child bearing are incompatible has obvious negative consequences for
women's participation in high-powered academic science.  A male
faculty member told us that if women would wait until after age 35 to
have children, there would be no problem. They would be able to pursue
tenure singlemindedly without intereference from other obligations. He
recognized that most women were unwilling to delay having children
that long and thus saw no answer to this dilemma.
 A graduate, now a professor at another university, reflected upon the
relationship between the biological and tenure clocks. In discussing
her plans for children she said: "I take every day as it comes.  It
would be outrageously difficult. I would feel much more confidence if
I had tenure but I would be 38 and I don't choose to have a child that
late."<p>



One female professor has spoken up in faculty meetings on behalf of
extending the time before tenure review for women with children. She
sees this recommendation as a double edged sword, however, pressuring
for reducing the demands made on women with children might jeopardize
their status by supporting the notion that women with children cannot
be productive. Of course, the extension could be made gender-neutral,
with the same provisions offered to men with extensive
responsibilities for childrearing. Nevertheless, in practice, this
would likely be seen as a measure to accommodate women. Departmental
and university-wide efforts to make workplace child care facilities
more widely available would help. An infant care center in a
neigboring school, discovered by one
 female graduate student, made a significant difference in
the ability of several  women with children, in one of the
departments studied, to carry on their graduate work virtually without
interruption.<p>



If the objective is to significantly increase the number of women
pursuing high-powered scientific careers institutional accommodations
will have to be made for women who wish to combine
family with career. To achieve equality
it is not just a matter of opening up opportunities but of changing
the structure of the academic system. Women
who wish to pursue traditional female roles along with a scientific
career must be accommodated by allowing a longer time span before the
tenure decision. This accomodation had been promised to one faculty
member in our sample but subsequently was not allowed.<p>

This is not  a call for a "mommy track" with different and lower
expectations of achievement and 
rewards  but a serious effort to accommodate the significant number of women
who are not willing to forego family and children prior to tenure.
It is unrealistic to expect significant numbers of women to follow
the male model. If the goal is to substantially increase the
participation of women in high-level academic science, a female model
will have to be legitimated. Acceptance of an alternative career model
is crucial both to placing more women in faculty slots in the
immediate short term and to providing relevant role models for a
broader range of female graduate students.<p>

Accommodation for time conflicts will have to be made for women faculty
members with children. Accomodation is currently made for faculty members, typically men,  who
found corporate  firms or research centers; however these  time conflicts usually
occur after tenure has been attained, whereas women's time conflicts involving family
responsibilities tend to occur earlier in their career trajectory, 
prior to tenure placing them at risk. While time conflicts at later
career stages may affect colleagues views of a department member, they
seldom if ever have deleterious career consequences. Simply put women are
more vulnerable than men prior to tenure. <p>




The limited geographical mobility of many women restricts their choice
of both graduate school and job. A highly successful female scientist
interviewed in another study explained the impact of location on her
career, given existing norms of hiring. A research associate, her
advance in rank was limited, as was her exposure to students and the
experience of raising her own funds. She felt that these consequences
of having to accept a position of lesser status had delayed her
professional maturation.  
<blockquote>
I was married---I'm still
married---and I didn't have the flexibility of moving around. That's
one of the best ways to achieve a permanent position and to increase
one's standing; to have the lever or the threat of saying, well, I,
I'm going to leave. And to mean it.  You can't do it as an empty
threat. You have to be ready to leave, and people are. I was never in
that position, so I could never use that threat, (Dupree, 1991: 117)
</blockquote>


A typical scenario that has been identified is marrying a man in the
same field who completes his graduate work before his wife. He finds
the best job he can without geographical constraints. When the woman
 finishes, she finds what job she can in a circumscribed region (Max,
1982).  Women who are already married often select their graduate
school based on what is available in a region and choose a job with
similar considerations in mind. Second rank research
universities attract many higher quality candidates than they might
otherwise, due to women's geographical restrictions.<p>


The limited geographical
mobility that many women face can be addressed in at least  two ways:

<ol>

<li> hiring both husband and wife, even in the same department, taking
account of the fact that graduate students in the sdame discipline
and department often marry.

<li>relaxing formal and/or informal prohibitions against hiring one's own
graduates.
</ol>

 The highest-achieving woman scientist in our sample was
hired by her graduate department after a stint at a local college.
This practice is especially significant for women who are geographically
immobile in a region with few or even only one research university.<p>


The succession of
impediments to the entry of women into scientific careers that narrrows
the stream to an extremely small flow at the stage of graduate
training has been conceptualized as cumulative disadvange. 
 However, even given these disadvantages a significant number
of women receive degrees in science at the BA and even the Ph.D.
levels.  Nevertheless, fewer pursue careers in science and there are
few senior women professors (Moen, 1988). 
The disadvantages that accumulate to narrow the flow into the science
career pipeline are supplemented by additional disadvantages, at the
margin, that discourage even the most highly motivated women who have
taken steps to pursue scientific and engineering careers at the
doctoral level. It is expected that removal of some or all of
these barriers at the doctoral, junior and senior faculty levels could
have an effect, in the short term, in increasing women's participation
in science and engineering.  Taking such steps could also provide 
 role models to assist in long-term efforts to
lower barriers at the early stages of the life course, thereby
increasing the flow into the science career pipeline.  Thus, the
importance of focusing policy intervention at the later stages is two
fold:

<ol>
<li>Encouraging the creation of a
critical mass of women faculty in academic science and engineering
departments that, in and of itself, has an effect in changing academic
cultures and, by implication, lowering barriers for future
generations,

<li>Revising the image of high level careers in science and engineering
for women from anomalous to "normal" provides the
incentive of examples of achievement to encourage younger
women to break through the barriers prevalent at early stages of the
career.
</ol>

These graduate students and professors, after successfully negotiating
the numerous barriers to entry that exclude so many other women, often
pursue less demanding careers than their male peers.  These women are
not lost to science.  Rather they are women who, with a few
exceptions, are excluded from positions in the top academic
departments in their field. Many pursue research careers in industry;
others have taken appointments in teaching colleges.  Whether these
scientists are excluded from high-level academic careers through
discrimination by academic departments unwilling to accept women as
equals or other reasons the result is the same.  There is a pool of
women scientists working in industry and lower down the academic
ladder whom their advisors, usually men, agree are the equal of their
male peers who are pursuing research careers at the highest academic
levels.  If professorial jobs were made available, qualified women
scientists could be recruited to create a critical mass of at least
three women in each leading academic department.  This would provide
the range of female role models necessary to bring forth an enlarged
next generation of women scientists.<p>

Culture is generally believed to be highly
resistant to change but our findings suggest a few key
points of intervention. Specific steps
 could be taken to mitigate the negative effects of the male
scientific ethos on the recruitment of women to science and
engineering. 
The rigidity of the existing academic structure and
male faculty misperceptions of women scientists constitute formidable
barriers to the entry and retention of women at the highest levels of
academic science. However, the fact that qualified women who would
be interested in academic research careers are now in industry or
teaching colleges suggests that, should these final barriers be lowered
or removed, women scientists who already exist might
pursue careers at the highest levels of academic science.<p>



 What can be done to implement these proposals?
  A first step is to become more self-conscious
about the social organization of human scientific endeavors
 By accepting various parochial ways of
conceptualizing, investigating and organizing the conduct of science,
significant sectors of the population have been excluded from full
participation, and alternative cognitive perspectives and
organizational styles have been repressed.  As we become aware of such
factors as masculine models of gender as the basis for many modes of
doing science, a policy space is opened up where change can take
place.  Social movements and support groups organized by excluded
groups, changes in departmental practices and university policies
taken at the initiative of faculty and administrators and governmental
affirmative action policies and funding programs are all part of the
emerging picture of science open to all talent in fact as well as by
precept.<p>


The second step is transcending masculine and feminine scientific
roles and practices (Abir-Am, 1991). The sociology of gender and
science itself has moved beyond comparing men and women scientists
according to implicitly masculine criteria. The traditional study of
number of publications, with article counts accepted as a primary
indicator of productivity and achievement, is ambiguous. Women publish
less frequently than men but their publications are more frequently
cited (Long, 1990). This finding may indicate different gender styles
of scientific work. Perhaps women work more intensively on a subject
before making their work public. There is much  to be
said for and against each of these styles of scientific work. 
Scientific practices that incorporate both
traditional male and female  perspectives
into a broader non-sexist framework would free both
 experimentation and verification of knowledge from the exclusionary
oppositions in which that which defines <em>feminine</em> as automatically
antithetical to "good science"(Keller, 1980).  Under these conditions
impersonal evaluation would be realized as a component of the social
structure of science.<p>
