Originally I was going to talk about MIT's undergraduate research
opportunities program and how well it prepared me for graduate school,
but I decided it was more important to let you know the problems faced
by women at research universities.
<P>
People often talk about having special programs to encourage women in
science.  One should not conclude from this that the educational needs
of women are different from those of men.  They aren't.  The fact is
we are not treated the same as men in coed settings, and special
programs are needed to make up for this mistreatment and not for any
deficiency in women.  Study after study has found bias against females
at every level of the education process.  I assume you are familiar
with the reports from the American Association of University Women and
the Association of American Colleges.
<P>
These biases exist not just in reports, of course, but in actual
student life.  I have heard that female MIT undergraduates have been
told by professors that they don't belong here and were only admitted
through affirmative action.  Not only is the statement unkind, but it
is untrue.  Women's grade point averages are the same as men's, even
when adjusted for major, and they graduate at a higher rate.  Can you
imagine coming to a challenging institute, filled with bright people,
and, already unsure of yourself, having <i> professors</i> tell you
that you aren't good enough before you've even had a chance to prove
yourself?!
<P>
The situation doesn't necessarily get better after a woman has had the
chance to prove herself.  A woman in another graduate program told me
that when she passed her qualifiers, her male classmates told her,
``Of course they passed you.  They wouldn't fail a woman at the same
time as they passed some men.''  The same response greeted a woman I
know when she got tenure.  It didn't occur to these people to say,
``Good job!  You should be proud of yourself!''
<P>
Videotapes of classroom interaction have found the following
unconscious biases:
<UL>
<LI> Women are interrupted more than men.
<LI> Faculty members make eye contact with male students more often
than with female students.
<LI> Faculty members are more likely to know and use the names of
their male students than of female students.
<LI> Women are often asked fewer or easier questions than men.
</UL>
While each isn't a big deal in and of itself, the cumulative effect of
all this is to make a woman doubt herself.  If faculty members and
classmates didn't pay attention to you except to flirt, wouldn't you
doubt your ability too?  People have been talking about special
programs to encourage women and minorities.  How about keeping the
current programs from <i> discouraging</i> these groups?  I know of an
<i> extremely</i> talented woman who left graduate school, on the
advice of her advisor, because they both knew the sexist mistreatment
she was receiving would continue.  (This was not at MIT.)  While
special programs are useful and indeed necessary, they should not be
used as an excuse to continue allowing the mistreatment of women in
mixed settings.
<P>
While I've painted a bleak picture, there is hope.  The faculty in
computer science here at MIT has been educated in the subtle and
not-so-subtle biases against women, and they have been working to
create a learning environment where women truly have equal
opportunity.  I realize that people are often resentful of having
agendas pushed on them from above, but do what you can to educate
people about bias against women.  Not only is educating people the
first step in getting them to change their behavior, but it shows that
women's underrepresentation does not mean they are inferior, a
conclusion I fear that people are now making.
<P>
Thank you for your attention.
