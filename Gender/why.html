    AI lab Technical Report 1315, August 1991, 112 pages. Why Are There
    So Few Female Computer Scientists? <br>

    <p> This report examines why women pursue careers in computer
      science and related
      fields far less frequently than men do. In 1990, only 13% of PhDs
      in computer
      science went to women, and only 7.8% of computer science
      professors were
      female. Causes include the different ways in which boys and girls
      are raised,
      the stereotypes of female engineers, subtle biases that females
      face, problems
      resulting from working in predominantly male environments, and
      sexual biases
      in language. A theme of the report is that women's
      underrepresentation is
      not primarily due to direct discrimination but to subconscious
      behavior that
      perpetuates the status quo. </p>
