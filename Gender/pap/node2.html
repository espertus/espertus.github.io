My report examines the following topics, each occupying a chapter: 
<OL><LI> Societal pressure against women's being successful, particularly
in engineering.
 <LI> Ways in which the male-dominated environments discourage women.
 <LI> Inequalities in language, their causes and effects.  
 <LI> Negative consequences of some attempts to help women.
 <LI> Conclusions and recommendations.
</OL>
At the end of the report are appendices which contain additional
information, such as the methods I used for data collection and
implications of recent research on sex-based intellectual differences.
Finally, there is an annotated bibliography.
<P>
The report does not directly address the problems of racial minority
group members, such as blacks and hispanics, who are also
underrepresented in computer science.  Readers should not interpret my
lack of material on this subject as implying that no bias exists
against these groups.  On the contrary, I have been told by a black
female computer scientist that the color barrier is greater than the
sex barrier.  In many parts of this report, such as
Section <A HREF="node7.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> on subconscious bias, the experience of people
of color is analogous to that of women.
