It seems possible that there are biological differences in the way men
and women think; certainly, there are currently differences in men's
and women's thinking styles.  There is no way to tell now how great
the biological differences are.  While they may imply that women will
never reach parity with men in computer science and in engineering,
there are two major reasons to believe that women's roles can increase
greatly from today's: First, as shown throughout this report, females
face immense cultural barriers.  Second, as alluded to in this
appendix, many technical fields play to men's strong areas.  Computer
science is built, in large part, on mathematics, which relies on
spatial ability.  Computer programming, however, does not in itself
require spatial ability, and some areas of computer science, such as
user interface design, require more knowledge of human psychology than
mathematics.  Additionally, sex-based differences are a tendency, and
their degree of effect in an individual cannot be known.
