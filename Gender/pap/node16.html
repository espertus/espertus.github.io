Because I take it for granted that readers consider sexual harassment
to be offensive and harmful, I am writing little on the subject.  It
remains, however a serious problem.  A recent survey of Harvard
students and faculty revealed:
<blockquote> Thirty-two percent of the tenured female professors, 49 percent of
those without tenure, 41 percent of the female graduate students, and
34 percent of the undergraduate women reported having been sexually
harassed by a person in authority at least once during their time at
Harvard.  Fifteen percent of the graduate students and twelve percent
of the undergraduates reporting harassment consequently changed their
academic plans because of it.  Most did not report the
incidents [<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, page 115--116,].
</blockquote>
Other studies, such as [<A HREF="node42.html#bakinf">Baker 1990</A>] find even higher percentages of
women sexually harassed.  See also [<A HREF="node42.html#grofem">Gross 1991</A>], an account of the
hostile environment for women at Stanford Medical School, which was
recently called to attention by the resignation of a female
neurosurgeon.
