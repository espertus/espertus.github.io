Perhaps the most insidious form of sexism is practiced by men who
are eager for more women to enter computer science, but for social
reasons.  The following quotations from female graduate
students are from [<A HREF="node93.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>, pages 14--15,]:
<UL><LI> ``A male graduate student said, `The problem with this place is that
there aren't enough attractive, available female graduate students.'
Enough for what?  I'm not here to be available and attractive.''
<P>
<LI> ``A graduate student said, `Men are tired of only seeing men.
They want to see women in dresses, not women who look like men.'''
</UL>

More recently, in a public discussion on women in computer science, an
ostensibly sympathetic male wrote, ``Sigh.  I'd love to see more girls
[sic] as my classmates!''  The ``sic'' was added by the moderator of
the newsgroup (who can edit messages before they are posted), in
protest of using that term for college-aged females.  This
sort of message is not uncommon.  In another discussion, a man wrote:

<P>
<blockquote> At the time, we were <i> really</i> trying to hire some females into the
software side and I was interviewing a bunch of new grads --- mostly
girls. There was this girl whose resume looked good and since she was
as they say --- easy on the eyes, I was trying hard to find reasons to
hire her.<A NAME=tex2html31 HREF="footnode.html#602"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</blockquote>
Such examples occur not only in informal exchange but also in published
books.  On several occasions, in <i> The Psychology of Computer
Programming</i>, Gerald Weinberg expresses opposition to sexism, decrying
prejudice (page 98) and scoffing men who initially fail
to take women seriously (pages 147--148).  The chivalry of
his appeal, however, undermines his point:
<blockquote> Each prejudice has its price.  In a programming project, the exclusion
of anyone from any position on any basis besides lack of competence
robs the project of the best possible performance.  Moreover, once one
faction begins to feel that they are being judged differently from
others, they will begin to act differently....  Possibly the greatest
single action to relieve the shortage of programming and programming
management talent would be to start treating women as true equals ---
if indeed they are only that (page 112).
</blockquote>
Additionally, at another point in the book, he refers to a female
employee as ``an attractive young thing'' (page 48).  Most women would
probably consider themselves better off without allies like this.
