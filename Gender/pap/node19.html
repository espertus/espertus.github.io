<P>
The English language has two sets of pronouns for the third-person singular:
he/him/his and she/her/hers.  It is practically impossible to talk
grammatically about individuals without implicitly mentioning their
sex.  While this can seem benign, it has several significant implications,
which will be examined in this chapter.
<P>
When A mentions a person unknown to B (``my biology teacher''), B must
find out whether the third person is male or female in order to know
how to phrase questions (``How is he/she?'').  If A does not provide
the information, B will usually guess the default pronoun from what is
known --- e.g. ``he'' for a professor, and ``she'' for a secretary.
Most often, this is done subconsciously, showing the speaker's
preconceptions.  It seems reasonable to expect that when children hear
their parents using their best guess for people discussed, they will
subconsciously conclude that a man's being a scientist, for example,
is normal, while a woman's being a scientist is unusual.
<P>
It is common for female scientists to be incorrectly addressed.  They
tend to consider these incidents humorous, and they trade horror stories:
<UL><LI>
One [female] computer scientist with an ambiguous first name wrote:
<blockquote> 
[M]y favorite case in this regard occurred about two years ago, when
I received a letter addressed to Mr. [Name], saying `Dear Mr.
[Name]:  I attended your presentation at the [A] Conference on
[B].  Please send me copies of your related technical
reports.  Sincerely, Dr. X'
<P>
Usually, my only response to such incorrect usage is to sign my return
letter as Dr. [Name], but that one was too much for me to let
slide unremarked.  So I sent a reply as follows:
<P>
Dear Dr. X:  While I am accustomed to receiving letters addressed to Mr.
[Name] from colleagues who have never met nor seen me, I found
your letter quite puzzling.  You began by saying you attended my
presentation at the [A] Conference on [B].  Surely
you must have noticed that I am female!  If this was a secretarial error,
you might alert your secretary that female computer scientists exist and
that in cases of doubt, ``Dr.'' is a genderless form that is unlikely to
offend (and may in fact be correct).  Sincerely, Dr. [Name].
<P>
I neither expected nor received a reply, but I felt better, and maybe I
saved some other female computer scientist from one of those letters.
</blockquote>

Ironically, when a science magazine ran a survey of its female
readers, the female journalists who received the responses found that
about half the women had addressed the replies, ``Dear Sir'' [<A HREF="node42.html#fertru">Ferry et al 1982</A>, page
27,].
<P>
<LI>
A female computer science professor told me:
<blockquote> When I was applying for jobs, two of the computer science departments
requested letters of recommendation for Mr. [Jane Linda Smith].  One
almost immediately sent a followup letter, explaining that they were
terribly sorry, that they indeed knew that [Jane Linda Smith] was
female, and that they would certainly read the recommendation letters
more carefully than they'd proofread their own request.  The other
department was the one in which I was then a graduate student.
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI>
When I received an award from the MIT EECS department for the first
version of this report, the award letter was addressed to ``Mr.
Ellen Spertus''.
</UL>
These examples show that some people expect scientists and science
writers to be men to such a great degree that they blatantly
misaddress female scientists.
<P>
Perhaps the most unusual story in this category is that of a woman who
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in the late seventies:
<blockquote> The scroll that [geneticist] Vivian [Davidson] received from the
Academy had her name engraved on it, and then went on to announce that
Vivian Davidson was being honored for `his' accomplishments, and that
`he' was now entitled, and `he' could, and `he' should.  She was so
amazed at all the `he's that she sent a letter to the Academy
inquiring whether the source of the problem might be that the engraver
was British and had taken Vivian for a man's name, or was it perhaps
that the printing process was lagging behind the process of election
of women to the Academy.  The letter she received back from the
Academy secretary (a man) was an angry one informing her that she was
the first person ever to complain, the scroll was an honor, its plate
had been struck in 1868 [sic] by Abraham Lincoln, and it had a historic
value the Academy was not about to tamper with.
<P>
At the next Academy meeting in Washington, Vivian raised the matter of
the scroll's wording with some of the other women scientists.  Each
one said she had never noticed the use of `he' instead of `she' on the
scroll.  `That's probably true,' Vivian said sadly.  `They're so
grateful to be allowed into the club, they wouldn't dream of making
waves.  In all likelihood they <i> haven't</i> noticed' [<A HREF="node42.html#gorwom">Gornick 1990</A>, page
115,].
</blockquote>
<P>
Also of interest are the experiences of a male professor whose first
name is also a woman's name:

<blockquote> I think having that name has made me more sympathetic
to problems women face, as in e-mail it is almost
always assumed that I am a woman.  That means I get
a rash of mash notes from the Math/CS students when
they first learn e-mail and pick my name out of the
user list....
It also means that I get a great response every time 
I post a computer problem to a usenet group.  Since 
I haven't done the control condition where I have a
male's name, I'll never know for sure, but the tone
of so many responses are so solicitous that I have
to wonder (even followups to see if everything
worked out okay).  
The worst case was in a scientific exchange through
the mail where the other scientist was being
exceedingly patronizing.  It was only when he
came to [X] for a convention and tacked on
his room and phone number and invited me for a 
drink that it dawned on me that he thought he
was corresponding with a woman.  For me I can
laugh about these occurrences (as well as the 
female roommates I routinely get assigned at meetings),
but it would certainly be different if it never went away.
