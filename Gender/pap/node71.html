In part because female computer science students so outnumber female
professors, one-to-one contact is not always possible.  Many schools
have get-togethers for women in computer science or engineering,
ranging from informal annual meetings to regular meetings of the
Society of Women Engineers.  Women find these activities useful for
receiving encouragement and advice, and they ``generate a lot of good
feeling'' [<A HREF="node93.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 23,].

Perhaps the most effective group currently existing for women in
computer science is an electronic mail discussion group with over
seven hundred members which provides women with a ``forum for
discussion of both the problems and joys of women in our field and a
medium for networking and mentoring'' [<A HREF="node93.html#frewom">Frenkel 1990</A>, page 36,].  Women
share advice on female-specific topics such as the best time in one's
career to have children, how to dress for conferences, and how to deal
with sexism, as well as general-purpose networking.  The list is
particularly important to women in computer science because they are
so dispersed and might not otherwise be able to interact with many
other female computer scientists and engineers.  Being part of a
discussion group with hundreds of female computer scientists can
change a woman's default image of a computer scientist from male to
female (or neutral) --- quite a difference from a student's academic
experience, where two thirds of the computer science departments have
zero or one female professors [<A HREF="node93.html#taulbee">Gries et al 1991</A>].
