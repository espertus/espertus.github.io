<P>
This paper was begun during the spring of my senior year, as a term
paper for a course entitled ``Women and Computers'', taught by Prof. Sherry Turkle.  Because the paper was so long and because I had other
graduation requirements, I did not finish it until the following
January, when I presented the paper during MIT's Independent Activity
Period.  I also distributed the paper through electronic means, mostly
to female computer scientists, some of whom further distributed
copies.  Because of the interest the paper generated and the support
of the department, I decided to turn it into an Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory technical report, the simplest way to
semi-publish a document.
<P>
I had expected negative reactions to my report, on the net and at MIT,
but I was pleasantly surprised.  Only a few netters sent negative
email, and nobody at MIT gave me any trouble.  In fact, the head of
the EECS department, Prof. Paul Penfield, was supportive of the
project, providing xerox money, and read the report.  The associate
head for CS, Prof. Fernando Corbat&#243;, attended my talk.  A number of
computer science professors, male and female, also read the report and
expressed encouragement.
<P>
I made many changes between the original and this version of the
report.  In addition to correcting typos, changes were:
<UL><LI> Correcting misleading statistics.
<LI> Incorporating anecdotes and reactions sent in response to the
original report.
<LI> Including material from additional articles and books.
<LI> Reworking the section on affirmative action to correct my prior
misconceptions.
<LI> Removing an email conversation with a ``flamer'' that had been
included as an appendix.
<LI> Adding an appendix on advantages women have.
<LI> Adding quotations to the beginning of the chapters.
</UL>
The differences between the two versions are large enough that I would
now prefer people to treat the original as a draft and not duplicate
or quote it.
