In addition to the people who consciously believe women less capable,
there are those who acknowledge that women can succeed at engineering
but consider female engineers to be ``somehow suspect'' [<A HREF="node42.html#tursec">Turkle 1984</A>, page
200,].  I will examine several aspects of this problem: First,
based on their preconceptions of women, people often exhibit subtle
forms of subconscious bias that cause them to treat women differently
from men.  Second, men and women are often held to different
standards.  Strange as it sounds, behaviors --- such as succeeding ---
are sometimes considered attractive in men but not in women.  Third,
there is something about our culture's view of male-dominated fields
such as engineering that causes female aspirants to be considered
unattractive.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00321000000000000000> Subtle Bias</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME=secsub>&#160;</A>
In [<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#sancla">Sandler 1988</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#halcla">Hall 1982</A>], there are summaries of several
studies of subtle, subconscious bias --- that is, people observably acting
in a biased manner but unaware of their doing so.  I was apprised of the
importance of subtle bias by the number of respondents who objected to
my call for ``egregious examples'', writing that they thought the
subtle behavior to be more damaging.  [<A HREF="node42.html#halcla">Hall 1982</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#sancla">Sandler 1988</A>] report
the following biases, of which both men and women are guilty:
<UL><LI> Women are interrupted more than men.
<LI> Faculty members make eye contact with male students more often
than with female students.
<LI> Faculty members are more likely to know and use the names of
their male students than of female students.<A NAME=tex2html6 HREF="footnode.html#126"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> 
<LI> Women are often asked fewer or easier questions than males.
</UL>
As Sandler writes, ``Singly, these behaviors probably have little
effect.  But when they occur again and again, they give a powerful
message to women: they are not as worthwhile as men nor are they
expected to participate fully in class, in college, or in life at
large'' [<A HREF="node42.html#sancla">Sandler 1988</A>, page 149,].  Unfortunately, the message appears
to have sunk in.  Studies have shown that, when engineering students
are asked to predict the academic performance relative to that of male
and female colleagues, ``both sexes anticipated that men would
outperform women.  This was paradoxical, since the average female
student had both a higher grade point average and higher class rank
from high school than the average male'' ([<A HREF="node42.html#ottfem">Ott 1975</A>] in [<A HREF="node42.html#zapsta">Zappert et al 1984</A>, page
4,]).  Another study found that, when male and female college
students were asked to predict their midterm test score before taking
it, men had higher expectations for themselves than women did for
themselves, even though the two groups actually performed the same
[<A HREF="node42.html#erkexp">Erkut 1983</A>, page 229,].  Studies have found that women are more
likely than men to attribute success to luck instead of skill
[<A HREF="node42.html#deaexp">Deaux et al 1974</A>] and to attribute failure to lack of skill [<A HREF="node42.html#ernmat">Ernest 1976</A>, page
599,].  Women's lack of confidence, and one consequence, is
illustrated by an incident at Columbia, reported by Professor Joan
Birman:
<A NAME=mathstory>&#160;</A>
<blockquote> I learned last year, to my astonishment, that for about four years
running the honors calculus course had been all male, in spite of the
fact that admission was based on an open competitive examination.
This fall, one of the senior mathematics majors and myself made an
intensive effort to encourage women to <i> try the exam!</i>  The
typical answer was, `I know I won't pass it,' --- to which we replied
over and over, `Well , if you try it, at worst you will confirm what
you already know, and only an hour of time will have been lost.'
After three days of such advising, the big day came, the exam was
given, and this year the class has five men and five women! [<A HREF="node42.html#ernmat">Ernest 1976</A>, page 604,].
</blockquote>
<P>
Not surprisingly, 

girls at single-sex schools study physical science and math more than
in comparable coed schools, ``even though girls' schools frequently
have less adequate laboratory provision than mixed schools'' [<A HREF="node42.html#kelwhy">Kelly 1982</A>, page 497,]
<P>
Even more ominously, [<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page 6,] reports:
<blockquote> In one study, first done in 1968 and then replicated in 1983, college
students were asked to rate identical articles according to specific
criteria.  The authors' names attached to the articles were clearly
male or female, but were reversed for each group of raters: what one
group thought had been written by a male, the second group thought had
been written by a female, and vice versa.  Articles supposedly written
by women were consistently ranked lower than when the very same
articles were thought to have been written by a male
[<A HREF="node42.html#golare">Goldberg 1968</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#palwha">Paludi et al 1985</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#palgol">Paludi et al 1983</A>].
In a similar study, department chairs were asked to make hypothetical
hiring decisions and to assign faculty rank on the basis of vita.  For
vitae with male names, chairs recommended the rank of associate
professor; however, the identical vita with a female name merited only
the rank of assistant professor [<A HREF="node42.html#fidemp">Fidell 1975</A>].
</blockquote>
Anti-female bias is strongest in traditionally male fields [<A HREF="node42.html#topsex">Top 1991</A>, pages
96--97,].
<P>
When discussing the results of such studies with fellow students, I
found that the males have tended to be more surprised than the
females, because many females recalled specific instances of biased
behavior, several categories of which are represented below.
<P>
In some cases, a woman was viewed as less serious than a man in a
similar position:
<UL>
<LI> A female computer science graduate student had the following
experience: 
<blockquote> I was working at a fairly small company whose communal coffee was
<i> awful</i>.  A group of 6 of us (4 men, 2 women) bought our own coffee
maker and had decent coffee which we paid a few cents for to defray
the costs of coffee and cream.  Anyway, I usually bought the coffee
and my male coworker usually bought the cream.  A new member to the
group (male) approached me and told me we were out of cream.  I told
him that M2 usually bought the cream.  Later that same day, M1 again
comes up and tells me we are out of cream.  I once again tell him that
M2 gets the cream.  To this he says, `But how can I bother M2 with
something as insignificant as buying cream?'  Needless to say, I told
this fellow exactly what I thought about that...
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI>

One female graduate student in mechanical engineering sent the
following two stories:
<OL><LI>
 When I first started the [graduate] program, the head of the
department (male) was assigning desks to graduate students...
([T]here were two entering females to the particular program at that 
time.)  As he ran out of desks, he said, `Well, just put the girls
together on a desk.'
<P>
<LI>
That same professor put me (a newly graduated math major) into the
slower (undergraduate) statistics class, and put a guy who had had a
vague introduction to stats 8 years earlier in the faster (graduate)
class.
</OL>
Both events took place in the past two years, a time period which she
has found ``very frustrating''.
<P>
<LI>
A female computer consultant wrote:
<blockquote> 
Most of our users ask for and accept help from whichever consultant is 
available, but some insist on talking with one of the male consultants (only
2 of the 10 consultants are male).  One user persisted at this, even after 
Alan explained to her that he didn't know the package she was working with, and
that she would be better off asking me because I specialize in that
particular software.  Another user did ask me her question, but when she didn't like the answer I gave her (I explained what she could not do and why), she
insisted on taking her problem to David (a higher authority?), who proceeded to
tell her exactly what I had just explained.  What is interesting about the
latter incident was that she did not seem to be after a second opinion,
because she could have gotten that from a number of people (all female).  She
apparently specifically wanted a male opinion.

<LI> 
<A NAME=parcmu>&#160;</A>
When a female computer science undergraduate visited one of the
graduate schools to which she had been admitted, she and a male
prospective student met with a male graduate student to discuss
the school.  Whenever the woman asked a
question, the graduate student directed his answer to the male
prospective instead of to her, i.e. by making eye contact and gestures
toward the male prospective.  This treatment surprised the woman, as
she had not encountered such behavior at her undergraduate
institution.   After the meeting, she delicately pointed out the behavior to
the graduate student, and he apologized profusely and sincerely,
clearly unaware of the bias while it was occurring.  When they met
later in the day, his behavior was markedly better.  The same woman,
however, in a later meeting with two other graduate students, one male
and one female, found herself addressing most of her questions to the
male until she recognized her behavior and corrected it.

<P>
The following examples show how people sometimes expect women to be
less interested or competent in technical areas than they actually
are:
<UL><LI>
According to a survey of female scientists:
<blockquote> Women in mainly male environments are always being taken for
secretaries or junior laboratory staff: queries may be addressed to a
male technician rather than his female boss.  An engineer offering to
help a telephone caller was told `No dear, this is a technical
enquiry.  Can I speak to someone who can help me?' [<A HREF="node42.html#fertru">Ferry et al 1982</A>, page
28,]
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI> A female computer science professor told me this story:
<blockquote> I was visiting a university and arrived before my (male) host.  I
approached the departmental receptionist to try to make certain
arrangements.  In one case, I suggested that my host might have made
some provision --- `or,' I said cordially, `maybe not.'  `Oh, probably
not,' replied the receptionist.  `After all you know those
professors...'  Boy was <i> her</i> face red when she realized what
she'd said.<A NAME=tex2html7 HREF="footnode.html#242"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI> 
A female undergraduate at a women's college wrote:

<P>
<blockquote> The summer after my first year at [X] I took Linear Algebra at [a
coed college] nearby.  Out of probably twenty people in the class, I
was one of two women.  I found that the mood of the class was
stifling.  It was obvious that the men of the class expected me to sit
quietly in my chair and contribute nothing and ask no questions.  It
was also made obvious to me that, in general, they felt they were far
superior to me.  Because I had had no contact with them outside of the
classroom, I must assume they were basing their decision solely on the
fact that I am female.  In addition, I found the material relatively
easy and was getting an A in the class, so they could not be basing it
on my academic performance.  One day as we were going over a difficult
problem set we had had for homework, the professor asked if anyone was
able to do a particular problem which I had been able to solve.  When
I raised my hand, [a student made] the comment `What?!?! How could
<i> you</i> have solved that problem!?!?' He in no way hid his hostility
or his feelings that if he, a far superior man, could not solve the
problem, I could not have.  I was completely shocked that he could
make such a comment.  No one else seemed to be.  It is no wonder that
women tend not to contribute in a male-dominated classroom.

A female computer scientist sent me a copy of the cover of a
prestigious computer periodical that showed a family (parents and a
boy) looking at a computer.  A bubble next to each shows what they are
thinking.  The mother is imagining her son using the computer to learn
math and the father using it to figure taxes.  The son and the father
both imagine using the computer to play space war games.<A NAME=tex2html8 HREF="footnode.html#243"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>

These diverse examples illustrate how women are sometimes treated as
less capable or interested in technology than men, instead of being
treated as individuals.  Of course, there exist professors and
administrators who treat their male and female students equally as well 
or even 

devote extra effort to encouraging women.  However, negative events are
still common enough to be of substantial concern.  Moreover, the above
behaviors are the symptom of a more fundamental problem: lower
expectations for females.  Many of the above events are too blatant to
have the insidious effect of subtle discrimination (which probably
accompany them).  Even if the
perpetrators could be coerced into not so openly displaying sexism, it
would not eliminate the fundamental biases which would be displayed
less directly.
<P>

As Sandler writes, the same behavior is viewed differently in women
than in men:
<blockquote> He is `assertive'; she is
`aggressive' or `hostile'.  He `lost his cool', implying it was an
aberration; she's `emotional' or `menopausal'.  Thus, her behavior is
devalued, even when it is the same as his [<A HREF="node42.html#sancla">Sandler 1988</A>, page 151,].
</blockquote>
This claim can be illustrated by a recent lawsuit by a woman who
``repeatedly heard that she had not been given a partnership at [a]
huge accounting firm because she was too macho, universally disliked
and in need of `a course at charm school''' [<A HREF="node42.html#nytwin">Lewin 1990</A>].  This is
despite having brought in more business than any of the other 88
candidates for partnership.  ``Comments from the lawsuit [say] that
she should wear makeup and jewelry and learn to walk, talk and dress
`more femininely''' [<A HREF="node42.html#nytwin">Lewin 1990</A>].  A survey of female scientists
found:
<blockquote> Most think their male colleagues are more forceful and aggressive than
they themselves want to be; some have resigned themselves to low
status rather than changing their personalities, while others have
decided to fight with men's weapons --- and are often labeled
unfeminine as a result [<A HREF="node42.html#fertru">Ferry et al 1982</A>, page 30,].
</blockquote>
<P>
One study found the same behavior judged more harshly in female
professors than in males:  
<blockquote> [According to] Susan Kay's classroom studies... male students were far
more likely to give lower ratings to those female faculty perceived to
be hard graders...  This finding is consistent with a series of
experiments at the University of Dayton that indicated that college
students of both sexes judged female authority figures who engaged in
punitive behavior more harshly than they judged punitive males...
([<A HREF="node42.html#marpow">Martin 1984</A>, pages 484--485,] in [<A HREF="node42.html#kobare">Koblitz 1990</A>]).
</blockquote>
See also [<A HREF="node42.html#kiesex">Kierstead et al 1988</A>] and [<A HREF="node42.html#benstu">Bennett 1982</A>].
<P>
A ``halo'' effect seems to exist where people tend to interpret
behavior according to their preconceptions.  The same action is often
interpreted differently, depending on whether it is performed by a woman
or a man, as the following stories illustrate:
<UL>
<LI> When a high-ranking female engineer was at the airport to make a
business trip, she saw a male acquaintance who worked for the same
company.  He asked where she was going, and she answered San
Francisco.  He then said something like, `Oh, going to do some
shopping?'  She told me how angry his remark made her, as she works
extremely hard at the company, putting in long hours and taking
frequent business trips, with too little free time for her to go on
out-of-state shopping trips even if she were inclined to do so.
<P>

<LI> A female computer science graduate student told me that it is
common to see different reactions to men and women dropping a class.
According to her, when a woman drops a class, people remark that the
class must have been too difficult for her; when a man quits, people
say he must not have found it interesting.
</UL>
These examples are troubling because they show one way in which stereotypes are
perpetuated. In each case, someone interpreted the actions of a woman
based on their prejudices, reinforcing their own stereotypes.
<P>
Additionally, women at American universities are often the victims of
other cultures' stereotypes.  Foreign nationals outnumber Americans as
students in doctoral engineering programs [<A HREF="node42.html#widaaa">Widnall 1988</A>, page 1740,],
and there are many foreign-born professors.  In one survey, female
graduate students at MIT ``reported that foreign-educated faculty ---
many from cultures where women are not held in high esteem --- pose
problems for women in graduate programs, both in class and in
research'' ([<A HREF="node42.html#mitpre">MIT 1987</A>] in [<A HREF="node42.html#baurec">Baum 1990</A>, page 49,]).
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00324000000000000000> Career-Related Success Unfeminine</A></H2>
<P>
Not only are some strong traits considered unfeminine, but
``femininity and individual achievement continue to be viewed as two
desirable but mutually exclusive ends,'' a shocking position 
argued in [<A HREF="node42.html#horfem">Horner 1970</A>, page 46,],
based on empirical research and interviews.  In one of Horner's studies,
females were given the sentence ``After first-term finals, Anne finds
herself at the top of her medical school class.''  Males were given a
similar sentence with a male name.  Subjects were asked to write a
story about the student.  While only 8 of the 88 male subjects
exhibited fear of success through negative stories, 59 of the 90
females did.  Horner divides the negative stories into three
categories and includes sample stories, of which I include a subset:
<OL><LI> Fear of Rejection --- ``Anne doesn't want to be number one in
her class.  She feels she shouldn't rank so high because of social
reasons.  She drops down to ninth in the class and then marries the
boy who graduates number one.''
<LI> Concern about Normalcy or Femininity --- ``Anne is completely
ecstatic but at the same time feels guilty.  She wishes that she could
stop studying so hard, but parental and personal pressures drive her.
She will finally have a nervous breakdown and marry a successful young
doctor.''
<LI> Denial --- ``Anne is really happy she's on top, though Tom is
higher than she --- though that's as it should be.... Anne doesn't
mind Tom winning'' [<A HREF="node42.html#horfem">Horner 1970</A>, pages 60--62,].
</OL>
Additionally, when questioned about Anne, ``[m]ore than 70% ...
described Anne as having an unattractive face, figure, or manners''
[<A HREF="node42.html#horfem">Horner 1970</A>, page 63,].  Females thus consider success to lessen
their femininity, a sacrifice many are not willing to make [<A HREF="node42.html#horfem">Horner 1970</A>, pages
69--72,].  See also [<A HREF="node42.html#medwom">Mednick et al 1975</A>].

<P>
This attitude can also be illustrated by the following incident,
reported in [<A HREF="node42.html#mla">Franklin et al 1981</A>, page 20,]:
<blockquote> One woman earned high grades in a traditionally male field.  Her
professor announced to a mostly male class that this represented an
unusual achievement `for a woman' and was an indication, first, that
the woman student was probably not really feminine, and, second, that
the males in the class were not truly masculine, since they allowed a
woman to beat them.
</blockquote>
<P>
Instead, the proper area for a woman's success is seen as her ability
to attract high-status men.  In a study for the National Institute of
Education, researchers Holland and Eisenhart found:
<blockquote> Men's prestige and correlated attractiveness come from the attention
they receive from women <i> and</i> from success at sports, in school
politics, and in other arenas.  Women's prestige and correlated
attractiveness come <i> only</i> from the attention they receive from
men [<A HREF="node42.html#holedu">Holland 1990</A>, page 104, emphasis in original,].
</blockquote>
This attitude is exemplified by the way one college woman attempted to
insult another: ``[You] may be able to do calculus, but I'm dating a
football player'' [<A HREF="node42.html#holedu">Holland 1990</A>, page 104, brackets in original,].  The
study found that female friends often did not even know each other's majors
[<A HREF="node42.html#holedu">Holland 1990</A>, page 14,], although they spent large amounts of time
together discussing other matters, primarily boyfriends [<A HREF="node42.html#holedu">Holland 1990</A>, page
14,].
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00325000000000000000> Implications of Gender Double Standards</A></H2>
<P>
The double standards discussed above should be a significant concern.
Aggression, competitiveness, and even some brashness are necessary for
a graduate student, for example, who must compete with other students
for equipment, funding, and attention from professors.  One doesn't
get far by politely waiting to be noticed or for other people to stop
using the computer.  In her paper on being a female graduate student
at MIT, Candace Sidner addresses some stumbling blocks women face:
<blockquote> Receiving an advanced degree, in fact, any degree, from MIT is rather
like being admitted to a fraternity.  One has a certain set of rituals
to go through, and both the process and one's performance define one's
position in the fraternity in the years that follow....
<P>
It surprises no woman to say that women are socialized differently
than men in our cultures.  What is surprising is the effect of that
socialization when women take roles traditionally held only by men.
The most significant role change centers [on] developing confidence
and competence.  Part of the process of hurdle jumping is not just
the getting over, it is the form which one presents in doing it.  For
the MIT fraternity ritual, the form is confidence; a woman student
must use what I call strutting behavior, that is, she must look and
act like she knows what she is doing.
<P>
While developing confidence from accompanying competence, is
difficult for all initiates, for women there is a subtle, but
remarkable difference; women in the everyday world are not supposed to
appear very confident and competent....  As a result, women must not
only build and show confidence and competence, just as their male
counterparts do, but unlike the men, they must <i> decide</i> first to
unlearn their normal behavior patterns....
<P>
The strutting behavior appears slowly; there are stops and starts,
forward and backward progress.  A woman student begins to act from a
little bit of confidence in her competence, and tests out this
confidence among her peers and superiors.  Two more difficulties
follow.  First, a woman feels less feminine, because in fact she is
less feminine according to the prevailing behavior patterns.  In her
personal life, her feelings may be communicated to her partner(s) who
may find her less attractive.  This threatens her personal status.
Eventually a woman can learn to find personal friends who value her
confident image, but the time in between is frightening [<A HREF="node42.html#sidwom">Sidner 1980</A>, pages
2--3,].
</blockquote>
<P>
Empirically, a comparative study of male and female Stanford graduate
students in technical areas [<A HREF="node42.html#zapsta">Zappert et al 1984</A>] found that women were less
self-confident and assertive than their male peers:
<blockquote> [W]omen less frequently than men reported that they felt free to
disagree with their advisors...and that their ideas were
respected by their advisors [<A HREF="node42.html#zapsta">Zappert et al 1984</A>, page 9,]....
<P>
[W]omen more often reported having trouble saying ``no'' and in giving
criticism.  Women also more often reported having difficulty sticking
up for themselves and tended to let annoyances pile up [<A HREF="node42.html#zapsta">Zappert et al 1984</A>, page
12,].

<P>
As if the culture-wide inhibitions to success were not enough, there
are additional barriers in engineering.  Nowadays, high school girls
from middle- and upper-middle-class families are expected to go to
college and to do reasonably well, but going to a technical institute
or majoring in a technical field is still considered unfeminine, as
these anecdotes indicate:
<UL>
<LI> 
 When a female student at an engineering institute went home for
vacation, her mother leafed through the book of photographs of the
freshman class and exclaimed in surprise, ``Why, some of these girls
are pretty!''
<P>

<LI> A male computer professional wrote:
 <blockquote> Back in 1983, I was a freshman here at [X] and one of my friends
was a genius who happened to be a pretty blonde girl....

She was also a freshman and spent one of her first days here searching
for her advisor's office.  While hunting around [Y] Hall, a man in his
early 30's came up to her and asked if she needed help.  She said that
she was looking for her advisor's office.  The man responded with a
puzzled, `What major are you?'  When she answered, `I'm in Electrical
Engineering.'  The man smiled at her and oozed, `Oh, you're <i> far</i>

<blockquote> I used to teach undergraduate computer science classes, and saw a
number of cases in which very promising and talented women abandoned
computer science, much to my disappointment since they were some of my
better students....  At least where I was teaching, the
discouragement from that field was given more by other women,
particularly in the sororities, rather than from within the field
itself.

It is worth repeating, however, that the stereotype of male engineers
is almost as bad.  Jokes and television portray male engineers as
unattractive, unpopular, awkward, and either unsuccessful with or
uninterested in women.<A NAME=tex2html10 HREF="footnode.html#244"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> However, I
believe that in our culture, females are more susceptible to such
stereotypes.  This is in large part because, as described earlier in
this chapter, femininity is considered to be at odds with success,
while masculinity is not.

While the stereotype that female engineers are inherently unattractive
seems to be without rational basis, scientific fields may well be in
conflict with some values traditionally thought of as feminine and
currently held by a majority of females.  The situation seems not to
have changed since the following was written:
<blockquote> I think [women's lack of achievement] comes from the general
orientation of girls, young women, and even older women, toward
`others' (in David Reisman's sense of being `other directed').  Women
are constantly urged to consider `Am I doing the right thing?' and
`What shall I be or do that will please my husband, children, and
parents?'  Occupational success never comes out as the positive answer
to these questions.  Pleasing others and doing the `right thing'
always means holding back, and retreating from a position of strong
ambition and career commitment [<A HREF="node42.html#epsbri">Epstein 1974</A>, page 15,].
</blockquote>
I would add that being other-directed might steer women away from
objective sciences into the humanities and the more people-oriented
social sciences.  Thus, the values that are encouraged in women would
not only make them less career-oriented but more likely to avoid the
sciences.<A NAME=sensitive>&#160;</A>
