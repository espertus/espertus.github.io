A taste for the abstract sciences in general and above all the
mysteries of numbers is excessively rare; one is not astonished at it;
the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves only
to those who have the courage to go deeply into it.  But when a person
of the sex which, according to our customs and prejudices, must
encounter infinitely more difficulties than men to familiarize herself
with these thorny researches, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting
these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, then
without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary
talents and a superior genius   --- Gauss to mathematician

As the data from women's career studies and anecdotes from personal
experiences of women professionals begin to accrue, one of the
questions that arises is not `Why are there so few successful
professional women?', but rather, `How have so many been able to
survive the vicissitudes on each rung of the career ladder?' </i> ---

<P>
There are a large number of factors that discourage women from
becoming computer scientists and computer professionals.  From early
childhood, females are treated differently from males, and, to become
computer scientists, they often have to face problems that males do
not have to deal with.  In this chapter, I suggest how people can work
to counteract these effects.  Because this chapter is based so heavily
on material earlier in the report, I recommend that earlier chapters
be read first.
