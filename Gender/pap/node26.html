<P>
Some people propose female-only competitions as a way to benefit
women.  However, the psychological effects of such contests are
sometimes negative.<A NAME=tex2html30 HREF="footnode.html#583"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> One female
undergraduate wrote:
<blockquote> 
I [disagree] with the suggestion that they have different
contests for boys and girls.  I believe this has a negative effect.
My high school was big on ``top boy'' and ``top girl''.  I think it is
from traditions like that I got the idea (now mostly eradicated) that
I would be smarter if I were male.  Until recently, I couldn't stand
not being the top girl in a category (i.e., being beaten by a girl),
but I didn't mind a guy's beating me.  The award categories seem to
imply that females can't compete with males.  Wouldn't people find
having separate competitions for whites and blacks offensive,
particularly if the blacks weren't allowed to enter the white contest?
</blockquote>
It should be mentioned, however, that some women believe that the
contests are worthwhile by providing rewards and encouragement to
highly-achieving females.  Thus, no consensus can be said to exist on
the issue.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00632000000000000000> Fellowships for Women</A></H2>
<P>
One popular way of encouraging female graduate students is through
special fellowships for women.  Again, the opinions are
divided on the psychological effects.  On the negative side, the same
student who complained about female-only contests wrote:
<blockquote> 
I am a senior, applying to graduate programs in computer science, and
was just offered a fellowship from [X].  At first, I was very
pleased and proud (called my parents, went out to celebrate), but then
I went back to my fellowship application material and saw that certain
fellowships are awarded particularly to women and minorities in fields
in which they are most underrepresented.  (I can't tell if my
fellowship is in this category.  I will try to find out.)  While I can
understand how such awards might be good for women who were very
worried about costs, the offer has left me feeling more bad than good.
For a few hours, I was thinking of myself as the best of the best ---
i.e. as having won the fellowship on merit --- but now I feel like I
wasn't allowed to play in the big league.
<P>
In contrast, I was offered a RA [stipend and tuition waiver in
exchange for research] next year by my bachelor's thesis supervisor.
That made me feel great.  If I thought the offer were related to my
being female, I would have rejected it.
</blockquote>
She reported that a male friend of hers said: 
<blockquote> I'm glad I'm not in a similar position --- you know I'm trying to improve
my self-confidence, and I'd feel so unsure in a world that wouldn't tell me
whether I was good or just the recipient of a less-deserved award.
</blockquote>
Another female graduate student wrote:
<blockquote> 
I don't want anyone ever to think that I got where I am because of
special favors granted to me because I'm female.  I decided ... that I
would not apply for any fellowships or special programs for women.  I
[don't want people to] think that I don't have to work as hard as a
man to succeed in my chosen career.
</blockquote>
<P>
The majority of women who expressed an opinion, however, supported
special fellowships and urged women to accept them.  One female
computer science professor wrote:
<blockquote> 
While I was a graduate student at [X], I got a fellowship that was
earmarked for women.  Initially I felt ... that while I was glad to
get the fellowship, ... it was second class in some way.  Two things
have changed my mind on this.  First, I found out that my fellowship
was in fact harder to get because it was a national contest rather
than a intra-university contest.  This solved my initial problem with
respect to the particular fellowship.
<P>
The second thing completely changed my attitude about what it takes to
be successful.  Now that I am faculty, I realize how hard it is to
raise money.  I now actively search for sources of funding that are
slightly unique to me: funding for women, funding for first year
faculty and so forth.  And why not?  Others look for funding that is
particular to VLSI say....  [W]e are judged on our output, and ... we
should take advantage of any opportunity that comes our way.  That
initial ... fellowship has caused doors to open for me all along my
career --- job offers, research funding, etc.  In hindsight I would
have been an idiot to decline it.
<P>
I now realize that my initial feelings about the fellowship said more
about my attitude toward women than reality.  That fellowship wasn't
second class, I just thought something special for women must be.
I've been taught an important lesson.
</blockquote>

Many people do not realize how competitive some fellowships for women
and minorities are.  The competition for the top women and minorities
fellowships is now so intense that a female computer science student I
spoke with was not surprised when she failed to win a special
fellowship for women but won the most coveted fellowship that was open
to both sexes.  Because outside funding makes graduate life easier and
because any stigma associated with special fellowships seems to be
decreasing, they are almost certainly a worthwhile way to help women
further their education.
<P>
Another issue is whether such programs are morally justified.  There
would be an outcry against a publicly-funded scholarship for which
only men were eligible, so a women-only scholarship program might not
be morally justifiable.  On the other hand, as this report has
documented, women face so many biases that there is reason to believe
that practically all women are unfairly handicapped in some way
relative to men.  Different people will have different opinions on
whether a biased program is a legitimate response to existing bias in
a community.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00633000000000000000> ``Heck, We Want More Girls''</A></H2>
<P>
Perhaps the most insidious form of sexism is practiced by men who
are eager for more women to enter computer science, but for social
reasons.  The following quotations from female graduate
students are from [<A HREF="node42.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>, pages 14--15,]:
<UL><LI> ``A male graduate student said, `The problem with this place is that
there aren't enough attractive, available female graduate students.'
Enough for what?  I'm not here to be available and attractive.''
<P>
<LI> ``A graduate student said, `Men are tired of only seeing men.
They want to see women in dresses, not women who look like men.'''
</UL>

<P>
More recently, in a public discussion on women in computer science, an
ostensibly sympathetic male wrote, ``Sigh.  I'd love to see more girls
[sic] as my classmates!''  The ``sic'' was added by the moderator of
the newsgroup (who can edit messages before they are posted), in
protest of using that term for college-aged females.  This
sort of message is not uncommon.  In another discussion, a man wrote:

<P>
<blockquote> At the time, we were <i> really</i> trying to hire some females into the
software side and I was interviewing a bunch of new grads --- mostly
girls. There was this girl whose resume looked good and since she was
as they say --- easy on the eyes, I was trying hard to find reasons to
hire her.<A NAME=tex2html31 HREF="footnode.html#602"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</blockquote>
Such examples occur not only in informal exchange but also in published
books.  On several occasions, in <i> The Psychology of Computer
Programming</i>, Gerald Weinberg expresses opposition to sexism, decrying
prejudice (page 98) and scoffing men who initially fail
to take women seriously (pages 147--148).  The chivalry of
his appeal, however, undermines his point:
<blockquote> Each prejudice has its price.  In a programming project, the exclusion
of anyone from any position on any basis besides lack of competence
robs the project of the best possible performance.  Moreover, once one
faction begins to feel that they are being judged differently from
others, they will begin to act differently....  Possibly the greatest
single action to relieve the shortage of programming and programming
management talent would be to start treating women as true equals ---
if indeed they are only that (page 112).
</blockquote>
Additionally, at another point in the book, he refers to a female
employee as ``an attractive young thing'' (page 48).  Most women would
probably consider themselves better off without allies like this.
