As discussed in Section <A HREF="node12.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, women are often judged as less
qualified than men when their performance is identical.  For example,
in one controlled study, department chairs were given nearly identical
curricula vitae of supposed male and female applicants and asked to
recommend their faculty rank. They chose assistant professor if they
thought the applicant was a woman and associate professor if they
thought it was a man [<A HREF="node93.html#fidemp">Fidell 1975</A>].  The following examples show how
these contradictions are rationalized: 
<UL><LI> A man is described as `serving on two departmental committees
and <i> even</i> on one institutional committee,' while a woman with the
identical experience is noted as `serving on two departmental
committees but <i> only</i> on one institutional committee [<A HREF="node93.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page
6,].
<LI> A woman who has published only three articles is denied tenure.
(`Yes, the articles are high-quality, but she should have published
more than that in 5 years.')  Later, a man in the same department is
awarded tenure.  (`Well, he's a slow starter, but he shows a lot of
promise.')  [<A HREF="node93.html#lataca">Lattin 1984</A>, page 227,].
</UL>
These studies contradict the assumption that, without affirmative
action, all decisions are purely merit-based.  In fact, few would
dispute that ``before affirmative action programs were developed,
women were routinely turned down for many faculty and most
administrative positions, regardless of their credentials'' [<A HREF="node93.html#lataca">Lattin 1984</A>, page
228,].  For example, ``Gerty Cori, the first American woman
Nobel Prize winner (for medicine or physiology in 1947) ... was not
promoted to full professor until the year she won the prize''
[<A HREF="node93.html#huninv">Hunt 1991</A>].  See also [<A HREF="node93.html#gorwom">Gornick 1990</A>] and [<A HREF="node93.html#seldoe">Selvin 1991</A>, page 28,].
Clearly, something is wrong with the way people make
decisions, and they must bend over backwards to make sure they
consider each candidate equally.
<P>
College admissions were also frequently discriminatory before
affirmative action:
<blockquote> The admissions policy of the University of North Carolina, for
example, was openly discriminatory [until the early seventies]:
`Admission of women on the freshman level will be restricted to those
who are especially well qualified'....  The American Council on
Education reported that freshmen who entered four-year colleges in
1968 had widely divergent high school grades: more than 40 percent of
the girls had averages of B+ or better but only 18 percent of the boys
could boast the same.
<P>
The attitude of some male alumni certainly indicates that they would
find nothing at all strange in having disparate admission standards:
In congressional testimony in 1970, Ann Sutherland Harris reported the
following: `At Yale, when the new women undergraduates protested the
quota on women and made the modest demand for fifty more women
undergraduates the coming year at an alumni dinner, an alumnus was
cheered when he said: ``We're all for women, but we can't deny a Yale
education to a man.''' And when Harris was questioned by Congressman
William D. Hathaway of Maine on school admissions policies, the same
bias become apparent: `Mr. Hathaway: If you take the college
administration and they have so many kids that they can take into
school and they know that 90 percent of the men, for example, in our
society have to get a job, and, say, only 50 percent of the women are
going to get it, and they have a limited number they will take in,
aren't they warranted in taking nine out of ten men and fewer girls?'
[<A HREF="node93.html#abrinv">Abramson 1975</A>, page 74,]
</blockquote>
With attitudes like this, clearly some sort of program is needed.
