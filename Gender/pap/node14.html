<P>
Computer trade shows and technical conferences are often even more
male-dominated than the workplace and university.  Some of the
specific problems of these events are discussed in this section.
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00451000000000000000> Trade Shows</A></H2>
<P>
Men far outnumber women at industry and academic conferences.
At trade shows, particularly, companies have ``historically employed
attractive women to draw attention to product exhibits or booths''
[<A HREF="node42.html#infsex">LaPlante 1989</A>].  While this practice has been declining, an industry
journal article about Comdex 1989 reports:
<blockquote> A number of companies still insisted on hiring scantily clad female
models to attract attention to their booths.  And a party thrown by
Fujitsu went far beyond questionable taste, seriously offending Comdex
attendees of both sexes [<A HREF="node42.html#infsex">LaPlante 1989</A>].
</blockquote>
Additionally, when women do attend, they are suspected of not being
legitimate attendees:
<blockquote> [PFS Inc. president Mary] Rich remembers attending the National
Computer Conference (NCC), a now-defunct computer convention, where
the male attendees outnumbered the female ones by a ratio of 300 to 1.
Convention officials as well as hotel staffs were extremely suspicious
of single women, Rich said.  Women were often suspected of being
prostitutes trying to solicit show attendees.  Rich said she once
tried to go to the hotel room of a colleague for a drink only to be
kicked out by security when trying to get in an elevator.
<P>
Rich, who co-chaired the 1986 NCC with another woman, said that as
recently as three years ago one of the primary concerns was how women
were being treated at the show.  `We still had problems with security
not believing [the credentials of] women trying to get onto the show
floor,' she said [<A HREF="node42.html#infsex">LaPlante 1989</A>].
</blockquote><H2><A NAME=SECTION00452000000000000000> Technical Conferences</A></H2>
<P>
Women are treated better at technical conferences than at trade shows.
While I have never seen any reports of a female speaker or attendee
being mistaken for a prostitute, people sometimes assume a woman to be

the wife of an attendee and not an attendee herself.  Additionally,
female computer scientists complain of being propositioned by male
attendees.  While this probably happens at trade shows too, its
happening at conferences leads to particularly touchy situations
because the women do not want to offend potentially important men in
their field and feel obliged to find delicate ways to reject
indelicate offers.  Because of this, many women act cold to men they
meet at conferences, which has the side effect of discouraging
friendship with colleagues who could be useful contacts.
<P>

A female computer scientist, with experience in several fields,
described another problem with being one of the few attendees who
needed to bring along their child:
<blockquote> One difference between biology and computer science that I have
noticed is that it is not unusual for childcare to be provided at
professional conferences in biology, while I have never seen it
offered at AAAI [American Association for Artificial Intelligence],
IJCAI [International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence], Cog
Sci, or ACM [Association for Computing Machinery] conferences. I have
a baby that I won't be able to leave overnight for about 2 years
(because of breastfeeding), but it is difficult to make daytime
childcare arrangements for an out of town conference oneself. Even
with an older child, it can be difficult to make the night-time
arrangements at home if the child is left behind (traveling spouse,
single parent, etc.), so bringing the child along might be preferable
if childcare were available.<A NAME=tex2html14 HREF="footnode.html#345"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</blockquote>
Additionally, another female computer scientist told me that ``some
conferences organize `spouse events' which tend to run to fashion
shows, shopping, etc.  My husband finds this strangely unappealing!''
<P>
Presumably, conference hosts do not mean to discriminate when they
fail to provide childcare or provide activities of interest to wives
of attendees --- I assume that, if the issue crosses their minds, they
assume that the number of exceptional attendees would be too small to
justify the expense of providing for them.  This is an example of how,
entirely in the absence of any bad intentions and purely due to the
ratio, conditions can be such that a class of attendees cannot
conveniently take part in a professional event.
