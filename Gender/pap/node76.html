Humor is effective for several reasons.  First, when men make
offensive remarks, if someone protests, they retort: ``Can't you
take a joke?''  When a woman uses humor to protest an offensive
remark, she can offer the same response if challenged.  Additionally,
humor breaks tension and often allows one to point out that something
is wrong without a direct confrontation.

One female computer professional told the following stories:
<UL><LI>
Shortly after my appointment, my boss, V.P. of Administration, called a
meeting to discuss the problems of the center.  All of the attendees were
male and deans or equivalent high positions.  The discussion in that meeting
was quite heated with adamant remarks about the problems in computing on
campus.  Towards the end of the meeting, one of the attendees started
pounding on the table and reviewed the names of the previous male directors of
the center, ending with the comment, `No offense meant, [Jane], but we need
a man in this job.'  I responded with, `I'm willing to do almost anything
to fix the problems in the Computer Center, but a sex change operation is
out of the question.'
<P>
That turned out to be the perfect response --- I got my point across and it
broke the tension with laughter.  The moral of this story is, that if you
can make your point with humor, the message goes down easier.
<P>
<LI>
Another time, I received in the mail an advertisement from a company
that sells disk drives.  The advertisement was included in a box that
contained Havana cigars.  (Obviously, this company assumed that the
mailing list they had of CIO's were all men).  I wrote a letter to the
VP of marketing for the company telling him that I thought that one of
his competitors were trying to undermine the intelligence of his
marketing organization by sending cigars to female decision makers in
his company's name.  Two days later, I received a federal express
delivery from him --- it was a bottle of perfume with a letter of
apology.  I thought his response was a good recovery.
</UL>
A computer science professor told the following story:
<blockquote> [W]hen I first starting teaching 13 years ago, I was married at the
time and both my husband and I had teaching positions in the same
department.  My department head was sitting in my class (at the time
we were in a joint math and CS department and my department head was
retraining).  [O]ne day, one of my students referred to me as Mrs.
[Smith] in class and I was feeling pretty frustrated by that point
since I had noticed that I kept getting called `Mrs.' while my
husband was [called] `Dr.', so I looked at him and said `What do you 
call Karl?,' and he replied `Dr. [Smith]'.  So I told him that I'd
appreciate it if he would use the same title for me since I had the
same degree.  Well, he wasn't the type to quiet down quickly, so he
retorted, `And what does Karl think of your feeling that way?,' to
which I replied angrily, `It doesn't matter what he thinks; it was a
helluva lot harder to get a Ph.D. than it was to get married.'  Word
apparently got out to the students after that because I wasn't called
`Mrs.' for quite some time.  (Of course, I was shaking by the time
class ended wondering what my department head thought of that
reaction.  He never did say anything about it.)

Female computer scientists have combined the techniques, role reversal
and humor, as in the following incidents:
<UL><LI>
A female computer scientist reported:

<blockquote> A few years ago I was at a workshop held way out in the country....
There were about forty people there.  I don't remember how many were
women, but there couldn't have been many.
<P>
At one point we were sitting around singing, and after a while
someone started one of those make-up-a-verse of your own affairs....
It went around for a while, and someone offered,
<P> 
I know a girl, her name is Jill. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
She won't do it, but her sister will. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
  <P>
<P>
Well, I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but I co-opted the next verse:
<P> 
I know a guy, his name is Bill. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
He won't do it, but his brother will. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
  <P>
<P>
Everyone laughed, and I thought the matter was settled.  But some people
won't give up, and a few rounds later, the <i> same</i> fellow came around
with:
<P> 
I know a girl, her name is Sue. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
She won't do it for me, but she'll do it for you. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
  <P>
Drat!  Can't back down now ...   I got as far as:
<P> 
I know a guy, his name is Lou.... <BR> 
  <P>
when the <i> rest</i> of my colleagues shouted down the offender.

A female computer science graduate student reported the following incident:
<blockquote> A [campus] career recruitment poster, several years ago ...  made
quite a splash.  The poster portrayed two men in shirts and ties
picking up a printout off a line printer, dropping the fanfold paper
all over the floor as they ogled at a woman walking by in a miniskirt.
The caption: `We think about more than just work here at [Company
Name].'  Outraged women began tearing the posters off the walls, then
(insert light bulb here) they instead made photocopies and put them up
in great numbers all over campus.  Meanwhile, the recruiters figured
out something was wrong and tried desperately to get rid of them.  A
number of women went to the recruitment talk to disrupt it, and found
that they were the only ones there.  Several hack posters were
created, for example one with two women in businesslike garb poring
over a printout while a scantily clad beach-boy type walked by, with
the caption, `We think about more than just sex here at [Company
Name].'  I believe the president of the company issued a
formal apology afterward.  This one is notable as much for the
reaction of the student body as for the poster itself.
