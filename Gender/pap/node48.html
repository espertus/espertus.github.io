<P>
The language used in the academic and industrial world, as in much of society, is
biased toward male terms.  A girl must have a strong vision to see
herself in a career considered masculine, and a woman must have 
strong character not to be affected by all the masculine assumptions
about her.  Still, there are some things to be thankful for.  As Grace Murray

Hopper has pointed out, when the computer industry began, many
women worked with computers, so job titles, like ``programmer'' and
``analyst'', were gender neutral.  That is one barrier less to
fight.  Additionally, the ambivalence about whether to use gender
neutral English and the empirical, as opposed to principled,
arguments used by many to support the old way, suggest that changes may be
made for the better.
