As discussed in Section <A HREF="node12.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, women are often the victims of
subtle subconscious bias.  For example, a woman may find that comments
are primarily directed to men in a group, unintentionally leaving her
out.  If the woman does not feel comfortable directly confronting the
individuals in question, there are more diplomatic methods of calling
the behavior to the person's attention: 
<UL>
 
<LI> In a meeting of three computer science students, the sole
female found herself ignored by one of the male participants.
Whenever she asked him a question, he directed his answer to the other
male present.  (See page <A HREF="node12.html#parcmu"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> of this report.)  After the
meeting, the woman took him aside and mentioned that she had noticed
he had directed his answers to [John] and asked, in a concerned way,
whether she had done anything to cause this behavior.  When he replied
that she had not done anything wrong and began to apologize, she
dismissed his apologies by saying that she was just relieved she had
not given him any negative signals.  He continued to apologize.
<P>
The indirectness of her approach allowed the man to save face while
still communicating the point.  It appears to have been effective,
because, when she saw the man later in the day, he made eye contact
and spoke directly to her.
<P>

<LI> At a social occasion, a young woman found that a male relative
directed serious discourse almost exclusively to her brother and not to her.
When the woman was alone with the relative, she said to him, `I hope
I haven't given you the idea I'm not interested in your opinions on
[X].  I noticed you directed your comments about it to [John].  I
want you to know I am interested in what you have to say on the
subject.'  The male relative replied, sincerely, that he had not
realized she was interested in the topic and would include her in the
future.
</UL>
While some people might object to these oblique methods, as they
involve the victim's pretending to put the blame on herself, they are effective
in situations where the woman does not feel comfortable being more
direct, and they often elicit an apology.
