<P>
Often, men make sexist or sexual remarks in attempts at humor.  As the
following examples show, this happens in classrooms, computer
magazines, and at conferences.  In most of these cases, the speaker
probably means no harm.  However, the behavior makes some women feel
uncomfortable.  In order to highlight the effect such statements have
on women, their reactions have been included where available.

<LI> A female graduate student had the following experience:
<blockquote> [A professor] in the introductory part of a guest lecture on robotics
to the graduate core AI class: (approximate quote) `Pretty soon we'll
have robots that are sophisticated enough to wander around in shopping
malls and pick up girls.'  I didn't listen to the rest of the lecture,
so I don't know what else he had to say.

<LI> A female computer science professor wrote:
<blockquote> 
When I was in graduate school, the professor in automata theory
introduced the topic of decomposition by saying: `Machines are a lot
like women --- many forms for the same function (wink wink).'  As the
only woman in the class, you can imagine that I felt terrific.  And
all of a sudden the guys sitting next to me sort of tensed up ---
instead of a fellow student, his remark had made them see me as
something else, something kinda dirty.

<LI> The narrator of the industry gossip column in the trade journal
<i> Infoworld</i> is an adult male with a young girlfriend Pammy,
shallow and uninterested in computers, whose silly statements and
actions pad the columns, such as her return to beauty school.  (``[A]t
21 she's older and can handle the pressure now.'')<A NAME=tex2html12 HREF="footnode.html#388"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>

<LI> A female computer science professor wrote:
<blockquote> [A]t a conference in France, a male speaker (French), who was speaking about
the importance of testing, showed an overhead slide of a naked woman
with a caption of the sort --- `Would you buy this product without testing
it first?' There were only 2 or 3 women in the audience (of about 150),
but I had fleeting feelings of having accidentally walked into a stag
party and wondering if he had either not expected any women to be there
or had discounted the importance of directing his remarks to the women in
the audience.
</blockquote></UL>
What these examples all share is that the male speaker or writer was
attempting to make a cute statement but that females (and some males)
had negative reactions.
