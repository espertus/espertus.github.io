<H1><A NAME=SECTION00430000000000000000> Behavior Due to Sex-Correlated Differences</A></H1>
<P>
An additional category exists of behavior that is not directly based
on sex but which nevertheless discourages women.  While attempts at
changing sexist behavior are partially effective, there seems little
that can be done about this category.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00431000000000000000> Socializing with Co-workers</A></H2>
<P>
Through no real fault on any side, a woman sometimes feels out of place
being one of the few women in a semi-social gathering with a group of
men, even in the absence of any behavior directly related to the sex
of the participants.  One reason is that, in our culture, men are
often interested in activities or topics that women tend not to relate
to.
<P>

A female graduate student complained about her experiences as a
teaching assistant (TA) for a course in a particularly
male-dominated area of computer science.  She wrote:
<blockquote> Perhaps because the percentage of males is often high, 
men tend to dominate non-academic discussions with topics of interest to
them, such as sports and cars, topics which women are often 
uninformed about or uninterested in.  The resulting inability
to participate in discussions can make it difficult
for women to bond socially, and often leads women to 
feel outright alienated...
This is exactly what happened to me at each T.A.--faculty meeting.
</blockquote>
Another 
female computer science graduate student described  a similar
experience:

<blockquote> My first summer at [a certain computer company], I worked in a group
that was otherwise all male.  While I got along okay with them and
never had any behavior to complain about, I didn't socialize with the
group.  For example, every day after lunch, they would go outside to
`shoot some hoops' [play basketball], an activity that I just did
not relate to.  For my next summer, I joined a group that had other
female programmers and a female manager.  I was much happier in that
group.  We would have barbecues, celebrate people's birthdays, and
socialize in other ways that I related to better than `shooting
hoops'.  My third summer, I chose to return to this group and not to
the first one or to find a new group.
</blockquote>
However, when she casually discussed her social dissatisfaction in an
exit interview with the department head, he pointed out that, coming
from a different country, he did not relate to American sports either.
This raises the important point, which holds for all examples in this
section, that dissatisfaction with certain activities is not strictly
divided by sex.  There are individual women who enjoy sports and are
better at them than some men.  Sex-based differences are a tendency,
not a fixed rule.  Sex-correlated preferences in our society, however,
are strong enough that these phenomena tend to work against women (or
whoever is underrepresented in a group).
<P>
Additionally, female group members do not always feel comfortable
joining male group members who go out drinking together.  Not only
might they not enjoy drinking, but some men are inclined to making
lewd remarks after a few drinks.  Thus, there are often times when
women feel unable to take part in activities to which, as group
members, they are invited.
<P>
Another problem is that some men do not feel comfortable socializing
in a professional manner with a woman, as this anecdote illustrates:
<blockquote> I was ... the first full-time woman faculty member in my department.
There really was difficulty among my male colleagues in associating
with a woman as a colleague.  I think they literally did not know how
to talk to me, and as a consequence often just did not talk to me.
They would ignore me.  They would not invite me to have lunch with
them, which was a very ordinary experience there ... they would walk
past my office and ask the next person and never ask me.  [Years
later] I asked one of my colleagues why this was so.  And he said,
`You know what would happen if I asked you to lunch ... People would
talk' ([<A HREF="node42.html#claper">Clark et al 1986</A>, pages 36--37,] in [<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, pages 7--8,]).
</blockquote><H2><A NAME=SECTION00432000000000000000> Different Communication Styles</A></H2>
<P>
The language that women use often differs from that of men in subtle
ways.  As discussed in [<A HREF="node42.html#halcla">Hall 1982</A>, page 9,], specific constructions
appear more frequently in women's speech than in men's: 
<UL><LI> hesitation and false starts (`I think...I was wondering...')
<LI> high pitch
<LI> `tag' questions (`This is really important, don't you think')
<LI> a questioning intonation in making a statement (`The second
chapter does most to clarify the theme?')
<LI> excessive use of qualifiers (`Don't you think that <i> maybe
sometimes</i>...')
<LI> other speech forms that are excessively polite and deferential
(`This is probably not important, but...')
</UL>
As Hall concludes:
<blockquote> If, for example, a woman student begins her comments hesitantly and
uses many qualifiers, she may be immediately perceived by her teacher
and by her classmates as unfocused and unsure of what she wants to
say.  Her `overly polite' style may seem to `invite' interruptions by,
or inattention from, both teacher and other students.  Indeed, even
the most insightful points made in this manner --- <i> especially by
a woman</i> --- may be taken less seriously than the identical points
made by a man or delivered in a more `masculine' assertive style
[<A HREF="node42.html#halcla">Hall 1982</A>, pages 9--10,].

A large part of Jenifer Tidwell's report on the Garden [<A HREF="node42.html#tidhac">Tidwell 1990</A>]
describes how men and women react differently to the same treatment,
due to their expectations of communication styles:
<blockquote> The persons I interviewed did not believe that women were treated
worse than the men were, nor vice versa, when I asked them directly.
(`Everyone is treated equally badly,' said one male informant.)  Yet
some informants, both male and female, commented that women may not be
able to deal with the Garden's harshness as well as the men do --- not
because of any inherent weakness, but simply because they have not
been brought up with the same expectations of `toughness' (in one
man's terms) that men have.  Furthermore, it seems more acceptable for
anyone there --- male or female --- to try to solve all one's problems
by oneself than to habitually ask for help.  All of the women that I
interviewed commented on this expectation of independence (whereas
almost none of the men did); they did not like it [<A HREF="node42.html#tidhac">Tidwell 1990</A>, page 9,].
</blockquote>
Tidwell writes that the attitude is that ``[what could be construed
as] harassment may just be social incompetence'' [<A HREF="node42.html#tidhac">Tidwell 1990</A>, page 15,
brackets in original,].
<P>

Anecdotal evidence suggests that women tend to be more sensitive than
men to general obnoxiousness [<A HREF="node42.html#widaaa">Widnall 1988</A>, page 1744,].  When a female
computer science student told me that a male TA had been inexcusably
rude to her in front of the class, I looked up the student evaluations
of the TA and found this comment, by another student:

<blockquote> [He] knows his stuff cold, but he's too rude.  Honestly, once you
humble yourself and tolerate this, he is an excellent source of help.
I owe a lot to him.
</blockquote>
A student unused or unwilling to being treated rudely would not be able
to interact with such individuals.
<P>
When I sent electronic mail to a group of women asking for criticism
on the first version of this report, one woman replied that my request
was unlikely to draw many responses.  Instead of asking for
``criticism'', she told me, I should have asked for ``feedback to help
me improve the report'', something women would feel more comfortable
supplying.
<P>
Steven Levy's <i> Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</i>
extensively describes the hacker culture, including the hackers'
apathy and even antipathy toward women.
<blockquote> Maybe it would have been different if there had been more women
around TMRC [Tech Model Railroad Club] and the ninth floor --- the few
that did hang around paired off with hackers....  There were not too
many of these women, since outsiders, male or female, were often put
off by the group: the hackers talked strangely, they had bizarre
hours, they ate weird food, and they spent all their time thinking
about computers [<A HREF="node42.html#levhac">Levy 1984</A>, page 72,].
</blockquote>
Levy goes on to describe the poor hygiene of one of the most admired
hackers, a young man who did not bathe [<A HREF="node42.html#levhac">Levy 1984</A>, page 73,].
<P>
Male computer environments that exclude women have occurred as early as
in preschool:
<blockquote> Even in preschool, males dominate the school computers.  In one
preschool, the boys literally took over the computer, creating a
computer club and refusing to let the girls either join the computer
club or have access to the computer.  When the teachers intervened and
set up a time schedule for sharing computer access, the girls spent as
much time on the computer as the boys [<A HREF="node42.html#kiepoo">Kiesler et al 1985</A>, page 454,].
</blockquote>
<P>
While it is not clear that one can justify the stereotype of the
engineer and computer hacker as socially backwards, women are deterred
by the environment.<A NAME=tex2html13 HREF="footnode.html#389"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> (See [<A HREF="node42.html#ihthac">Markoff 1989</A>], for example.)
Additionally, whether the stereotype is accurate is to some extent
irrelevant: If females believe that to study or work with computers
requires hanging around socially incompetent nerds, the stereotype,
true or false, may influence their decision.
