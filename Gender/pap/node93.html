``Barriers to Women in Undergraduate Computer Science: The Effects of
the Computer Environment on the Success and Continuance of Female
Students.''  PhD Thesis, Division of Teacher Education, University of
Oregon, 1990.   A study of female undergraduates' computer
science experiences at a large public university, based on interviews,
class records, and the literature.  One of its major findings is that,
although women drop out of the school's computer science program more
than men, women outperformed men in most of the required computer
science courses, suggesting that their underrepresentation was not due
to lack of ability.  The author can currently be contacted at Columbia
Union College, Maryland.
