<H2><A NAME=SECTION00521000000000000000> The Inequality of Masculine and Feminine Terms</A></H2>
<P>
Because male and female pronouns have different connotations, an
individual is immediately categorized into a set and assumed to have
certain characteristics as soon as their sex is known.  The English
language forces us to divide people by sex, and, because people have
different assumptions depending on whether someone is male or female,
preconceptions are applied to them.  Were it not for these
differences, asking someone's sex would have no greater import than
asking how to properly pronounce a person's name, and suggesting that
females need female role models would make no more sense than arguing
that green-eyed people need green-eyed role models.  While there is no
reason that specifying the sex of an individual is necessarily bad, it
is in a culture where people associate so many characteristics with
sex.
<P>
When masculine and feminine versions of the same word exist, the
connotations often greatly differ:
<UL><LI> A teacher writes of trying to describe one of her brightest
students:
<blockquote> I found myself saying `She's really a prince.'  Appalled as I was at
my own pro-masculine description, I just couldn't say that she was a
<i> princess</i> because princess connotes someone who is fussy and
spoiled and accustomed to living in the lap of luxury [<A HREF="node42.html#milwor">Miller et al 1980</A>, page
58,].
</blockquote>
<LI> A female computer science student told me:
<blockquote> When I was at [X], I derived a good deal of satisfaction from watching
my male friends describe my performance in [electrical engineering
courses] --- `She's a .....goddess?' 
</blockquote></UL>
<P>
Additionally, ``woman'' and ``man'' are not symmetrical:
<UL><LI> As observed in [<A HREF="node42.html#hofmet">Hofstadter 1986</A>, page 155,]:
<blockquote> If I write, `In the nineteenth century, the kings of nonsense were
Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll', people will with no trouble get the
message that those two men were the best of all nonsense writers at
that time.  But now consider what happens if I write, `The queen of
twentieth-century nonsense is Gertrude Stein'.  The implication is
unequivocal: Gertrude Stein is, among <i> female</i> writers of
nonsense, the best.  It leaves completely open her ranking relative to
males.  She might be way down the list!  Now isn't this preposterous?
Why is our language so asymmetric?  This is hardly chivalry --- it is
utter condescension. 
</blockquote>
<LI>
One female computer science professor told me:
<blockquote> I got a recommendation from a college professor stating that I was
`one of the top female students' in his class ( 100 students,  10
women, the women were not all at the top of the class, and I <i>
was</i>)....  I'm sure he meant it as a compliment.
</blockquote>
<LI>
Annie Edson Taylor is described as ``the first <i> person</i> to go
over Niagara Falls in a barrel'', while Neil Armstrong is ``the first
<i> man</i> to walk on the moon''.
</UL>
Because masculine and feminine terms have such different connotations,
the distinctions make females separate and <i> unequal</i>.

Some men consider ``being a man'' to be high praise even to a woman,
and expect her to be flattered at being called one.  Here are some
examples of women's reactions to being called a man, two from
biographies (not of computer scientists) and one in response to my
call for data:
<UL><LI>
Henry Hazlitt said to Ayn [Rand] one day: `I just talked with Lu Mises
a few days ago.  He called you ``the most courageous man in
America.'''  `Did he say <i> man</i>?' asked Ayn.  `Yes,' he replied.
Ayn was delighted.<A NAME=tex2html17 HREF="footnode.html#512"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>

[A] story --- which as far as I know, is all it was, --- once went the
rounds of Israel to the effect that Ben-Gurion described me [Golda
Meir] as the `only man' in his cabinet.  What amused me about it was
that obviously he (or whoever invented the story) thought that this
was the greatest possible compliment that could be paid to a woman.  I
very much doubt that any man would have been flattered if I had said
about him that he was the only woman in the government!<A NAME=tex2html18 HREF="footnode.html#513"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>

[This incident] was ... entertaining.  I and another undergraduate
were head teaching fellows for a computer course and we were working our
butts off.  He had one final that he was pretty worried about, so I
greeted him afterwards with a six pack.  His remark, `[Jane], you're
such a guy.' --- A female graduate student.
</UL>
In all cases, the original speaker thought he was giving the woman a
high compliment.  What stands out from these quotes is the different
reactions: glee in one case, indignation and amusement in the others.
Accepting such compliments is psychologically dangerous because it
entails a woman's looking down upon her own sex.  For example, Ayn Rand,
the only female above to be proud of being ``a man'', is known for her
misogyny, an unhealthy trait for a woman.  The same
phenomenon occurs among some women in male-dominated careers.  One

female computer science graduate student used the term
``male-identified'' to describe women who scorn other women and who
aspire to be ``one of the guys''.  Some examples of such statements are:
<UL>
<LI>
A male computer professional wrote:
<blockquote> One way [bias is expressed] is the attitude of women themselves.  A
female programmer here found out that the company next door, run by
women, installs PC systems in offices.  Her comment was, `That's
pretty good for a couple of women.'  Her words, not mine.
</blockquote>
<P>

<LI>
A female computer science student, when one of two female students in
a high school advanced placement physics class, said: ``I judge how
hard a class is by how few females are in it.''
</UL>
While the above comments are shocking, they should be no less shocking
than a man's expecting a woman to be flattered by being called a man.
In the context of a society which praises women for being ``like a
man,'' it is no wonder some women accept the role.<A NAME=tex2html19 HREF="footnode.html#443"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>	[<A HREF="node42.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>] contains many
examples of masculine terms in everyday use.

<P>
Other terms exist besides ``being a man'' and ``one of the guys''.  A
male high school teacher who recognized the sexism in ``dividing the
men from the boys,'' told the class that he intentionally replaced the
terms with ``wimps'' and ``studs,'' a usage he did not consider to
have gender implications.  Indeed, ``stud'' is now a popular way to
compliment someone from work well done.  What's ironic is that
``stud'' is an extremely male word.  Its primary definition is a male
animal used for breeding.  It is absurd that some consider it a
gender-free way to express admiration.<A NAME=tex2html20 HREF="footnode.html#446"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> When a female

professor expressed skepticism that anyone could think ``stud'' a
neutral term, it was called to her attention that a few months
earlier, she had told a roomful of female students that they would
have to ``gird their loins'' and get to work.  This also derives from
male terms.
