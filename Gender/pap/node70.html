Finding female role models and mentors can also be helpful to a
woman's self-image.  While male mentors are certainly useful, and many
women are happy with male advisors, female role models serve the
additional purpose of providing a living example of a successful
female scientist.  One study found that ``[f]emale graduate students
who identified female professors as role models viewed themselves as
more career oriented, confident, and instrumental than did female
students identifying male role models'' [<A HREF="node93.html#gilsex">Gilbert et al 1983</A>, page 597,],
although, as the report notes, self-selection may also have been a
factor [<A HREF="node93.html#gilsex">Gilbert et al 1983</A>, page 605,].  As noted in [<A HREF="node93.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 20,]:
<blockquote> The importance of mentoring and role models cannot be stressed too
much.  One female student ... wrote about her experience in a summer
job working for a female manager who she described as: `one of the
most respected people in the company.  I had never expected that
having a female role model would change the way I felt about myself,
but it did'.
</blockquote>
Thus, a female student should consider finding a senior woman in her
field  to work for at school or during a summer job.  While a
person's sex should not be the primary factor in choosing a mentor,
spending some time with a female role model can be psychologically
beneficial.  (See also [<A HREF="node93.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, pages 104--109,].)
