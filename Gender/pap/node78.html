As described in Section <A HREF="node12.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, many people treat men and women
differently without realizing it.  Once people understand that it is
possible for a well-meaning person to unintentionally discriminate,
they should train themselves to oversee or spot check their behavior
to make sure they do not behave in such a manner.  Anecdotal evidence
suggests that, once people become aware of subconscious bias, they often
catch themselves behaving in such a way.  This is true of women as
well as of men.  Fortunately, once a person is aware of the problem,
the behavior is usually easy to change.  Examples of behaviors to avoid are:
<UL><LI> Assuming, without any information, that women should be given
easier questions or projects than men.
 <LI> Paying more attention to remarks made by men than by women.
 <LI> Assuming, when introduced to a team, that a male is the leader
and primarily addressing comments to him.
 <LI> If a man, being more friendly and encouraging to male peers and
subordinates than to females, even if it is out of a desire to avoid
having one's friendliness mistaken for flirtation.
 <LI> Assuming that a woman will not pursue her career as seriously
as a man because she will leave her job to have children.  While some
women take time off for children, all women (and no men) are hurt by
this prejudice.
</UL>
<P>
Additionally, one can help counteract another person's subconscious
bias by either discreetly calling it to the person's attention or by
directly offsetting it.  For example, if a female colleague keeps
getting interrupted or ignored, one can express interest in what she
is saying without directly telling people to listen to her, which
might be interpreted as patronizing.
<P>

A female graduate student provided me with some positive examples of
how her advisor treated her.  In addition to generally treating her
with respect, by giving her challenging projects and the necessary
resources to complete them, there were two specific things he did that
especially impressed her:
<UL><LI> When the student was preparing a paper the two of them
co-authored for a conference, she
made a dozen copies to send in, as required by the program committee.
When her advisor saw her collating them, he told her that she should
have had the group secretary do that.  The student was impressed with
this remark because she felt other professors might see nothing
wrong with a female's doing clerical work but would have only redirected 
male students to a secretary.
 <LI> When the student proofread a paper for her advisor, he thanked
her by name in the acknowledgments ``for her careful proofreading of this
paper and [acknowledged] her ongoing study of [related research
area]''.  By mentioning her research area, the advisor made clear to
readers that, despite her female name, she was not a secretary.
