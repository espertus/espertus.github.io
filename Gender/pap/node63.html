After men are made aware that women are unhappy with receiving
unwanted and improper attention from male colleagues, there is the
risk that they will be hesitant to socialize with females.  This
phenomenon followed the distribution of the MIT report on
discrimination [<A HREF="node93.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>, page 19,].  Because informal interaction is an
important part of the educational process, this represents a serious
loss.  For example, it is not uncommon for professors to have meals
with their students.  It would be a shame if they failed to invite
their female students, out of fear of being misunderstood.
<P>

Hypersensitivity on both sides occasionally escalates an innocent
incident into a colossal misunderstanding.  When ``Jane'' was
interviewed for a job by ``John'', she found the interview style
strange.  John spent almost all the time talking about the company and
appeared uninterested in hearing Jane say anything about herself.
Jane mentioned she thought this style odd.  Later, she spoke to a
friend ``Mark'' who had worked at the company and was friends with
John.  He said that John had said that Jane was suspicious at the
interview and seemed to think that she was being interviewed purely
for quotas --- i.e. that they were not interested in her
qualifications.  This idea had never crossed Jane's mind --- until
that point.  After Mark made some further statements about how the
company's leaders were opposed to affirmative action, Jane decided it
was likely that the reason she had not been asked many questions was
because they did not want to hire a female.  She felt confident of
this conclusion when they offered a job to a male whom she considered
to be of equal skill to
herself.  A few days later, however, they invited her for a plant
visit and offered her a job.  Thus, both John and Jane incorrectly
leapt to conclusions.
