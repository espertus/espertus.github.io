Indirect methods are also often more effective than direct means for
dealing with offensive sexist and sexual comments.  As mentioned in
Section <A HREF="node23.html#secfem"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, the only consequence of complaining is often
that one is dismissed as a `feminist'.  In a recent column in <i> The New
York Times</i>, a woman described her experience as a college journalist:
<blockquote> Though I was militantly middle of the road in perspective, by the
second time I mentioned sexism in print I was pegged.  People I met
seemed to treat me like a Marxist, a radical, a testosterone-fueled
male-basher; others asked me why I suddenly hated men so much; and
certain folks at home warned me that I was going to jeopardize my
future by scaring off potential male suitors [<A HREF="node93.html#nytfem">Kamen 1990</A>].
</blockquote>
Two techniques that are often more effective than anger (even when
justified) are role reversal, which involves the substitution of
other terms for female terms, and humor.  Combinations of these two
techniques are especially effective.
