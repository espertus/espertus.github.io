It is telling to look at the reaction to <i> MacTech Quarterly</i>'s
policy, printed in the issue following the editorial announcement [<A HREF="node93.html#mactec2">MTQ 1989B</A>].  A
follow-up article wrote that responses poured in, ``impassioned on
both sides''.  Some readers canceled their subscriptions, while others
pledged to buy as much as possible from the parent organization.  One
of the most interesting positive letters was from a female novice
programmer who wrote:
<blockquote> [A]s a woman who is a bit intimidated by her love of math and computers,
I deeply appreciate being able to open the MacTech Quarterly and have
the articles addressed to me, personally, a woman.
</blockquote>
Negative letters condemned the (male) editor for abusing his editorial
position.  One particularly angry writer repeatedly called into question
the editor's manhood: 
<blockquote> 
Ms. Hines,
<P>
You seem to be suffering from severe gender confusion.  As a private
matter, that's fine.  Everyone has their foibles.  But when it becomes
editorial policy it's offensive in the extreme....
<P>
When I feel like listening to emasculated male apologists I can always
turn on Donahue.  He's easy to turn off and I don't have to pay for
broadcasting his silly ideas.  So unless you will be adopting a more
well-thought-out policy, cancel my subscription and send my refund.  And
I will suggest MTQ adopt the subtitle, ``A Magazine for High Tech Women
and Eunuchs''.
<P>
If you've got even a dim memory of when you had balls, you'll print
this.
</blockquote>
(Note too the use of ``balls'', i.e. something women do not possess, as a
metaphor for fortitude.)  The letter illustrates that a man is
sometimes considered
to be a sell-out for taking a feminist position.  (While some men
praised the editor for his decision, apparently all of the harshest critics
were male.)  In addition to the above <i> ad hominem</i> letter, there
were more carefully-reasoned objections:
<OL><LI> Because of its long usage as the neutral pronoun, the sex of
``he'' is much less blatant than that of ``she''.
 <LI> Using the less grammatical ``they'' for the singular neutral
pronoun is a reasonable choice, particularly as it appears to have been
used centuries ago for this purpose.<A NAME=tex2html23 HREF="footnode.html#516"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
 <LI> Most of the readers of the magazine are male.
</OL>
Even in the most carefully-reasoned negative letter, however, the writer
expressed his intention not to renew his subscription.<A NAME=tex2html24 HREF="footnode.html#503"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>  This is clearly a point on which people have strong opinions.
<P>
In response to my call for information, a man wrote:

<blockquote> I'm the co-author of the [X] Guide;... One of the decisions that I made
was to remove all the sexist language, e.g. ``when the user types <i> his</i>
command'' sort of stuff.  It wasn't that hard to do, and I figured that
it was appropriate.
<P>
A couple of the reviewers ...  noticed this --- I suppose my prose
wasn't quite as seamless as I thought it was --- and commented on it.
They both suggested putting the male gender pronouns back in since
``most of the users are men, anyway''.  I didn't take this suggestion;
but what struck me was that these folks actually noticed the <i>
lack</i> of male pronouns.
