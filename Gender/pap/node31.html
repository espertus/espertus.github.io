<P>
A common thread through the previous chapters is that, for the
most part, people are not consciously trying to discourage women from
science and engineering.  Instead, people's behavior is often
subconsciously influenced by stereotypes that they may not even
realize they have.  Additionally, when companies direct technical
games and products to men, their intent is not to perpetuate
stereotypes but to target the largest existing audience.  That some
women feel uncomfortable in mostly male environments is not primarily
a result of men's trying to make them feel unwelcome but of dynamics
resulting directly from the male majority and societal sex-based
differences in behavior.  While perhaps it is comforting to know that
no conspiracy exists against female computer scientists, it also means
that the problem is harder to fight.  The negative influences described
in this report are so varied and decentralized that there is no simple
way to level the playing field.
<P>
One positive factor is that women and other underrepresented groups
are becoming a crucial resource pool.  The number of white males of
college age is decreasing, while the need for engineers and scientists
is increasing [<A HREF="node42.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 7,].  I have been told this is
causing even the most conservative businessmen to begin aggressively
targeting women and minorities as highly-trained technical workers.
<P>
Another reason for optimism is seeing how greatly the situation has
changed.  Although discrimination against women continues, it is
nothing compared to the level earlier this century or in the previous
one, as some of the quotations at the beginning of chapters have
indicated.  Unfortunately, there has been retrograde motion before: In
the 1920s, feminist activity reduced sexual discrimination at
prestigious universities, but ``this trend toward equity was reversed
in the 1930s and not resumed until the 1960s'' [<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, page
xi,].
