<P>
While there is a need for affirmative action programs, they have large
negative effects that must be considered.  Even if a program does not
entail lower standards for women, doubts are cast on a woman's
qualifications in a society that already mistrusts them.  Programs
with lower qualifications may be a tactical mistake (in addition to
being unjust) because people may be put in situations for which they
are not qualified, giving them less overall success and
self-confidence than they would have had otherwise.  These negative
effects should be weighed when considering implementing an affirmative
action program.
<P>
As phrased in [<A HREF="node93.html#ernmat">Ernest 1976</A>, page 607,]:
<blockquote> We strongly support such affirmative action to ensure that all
potential female candidates are considered.  Such increased
recruitment efforts can only enlarge the list of qualified candidates
and thus result in the <i> raising</i> of standards.  To immediately
dispose of a red herring, let us state emphatically that none of us
believe a <i> less</i> qualified [scientist] should be hired, just
because she is female.
