<P>
One area currently under debate is gender-neutral English.  Above,
I discussed the issue of how to discuss a specific unknown person, but
it is another question how to discuss a generic person, i.e. with
``he'' or ``he or she'', etc.  Related to this is whether to use terms
like ``chairman'' and ``man-hours'' when one does not wish to exclude
females.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00531000000000000000> Background</A></H2>
<P>
The most convincing argument that terms like ``he'' and ``man'' are
not truly neutral comes not from abstract arguments but from empirical
research:
<blockquote> In 1972, two sociologists at Drake University, Joseph Schneider and
Sally Hacker, decided to test the hypothesis that <i> man</i> is
generally understood to embrace <i> woman</i>.  Some three hundred
college students were asked to select from magazines and newspapers a
variety of pictures that would appropriately illustrate the different
chapters of a sociology textbook being prepared for publication.  Half
the students were assigned chapter headings like ``Social Man'',
``Industrial Man'', and ``Political Man''.  The other half was given
different but corresponding headings like ``Society'', ``Industrial
Life'', and ``Political Behavior''.  Analysis of the pictures selected
revealed that in the minds of students of both sexes use of the word
<i> man</i> evoked, to a statistically significant degree, images of
males only --- filtering out recognition of women's participation in
these major areas of life --- whereas the corresponding headings
without <i> man</i> evoked images of both males and females.  In some
instances the differences reached magnitudes of 30 to 40 per cent.
The authors concluded, `This is rather convincing evidence that when
you use the word <i> man</i> generically, people do tend to think male,
and tend not to think female ([<A HREF="node42.html#milwor">Miller et al 1980</A>, pages 19--20,]).
</blockquote>
Additionally, ``a number of studies have shown that
young people are influenced in their job preferences and their
willingness to apply for advertised jobs by gender bias in the wording
of the advertisements'' ([<A HREF="node42.html#bemdoe">Bem et al 1973</A>] in [<A HREF="node42.html#fralan">Frank et al 1983</A>, page 90,]).
<P>
Several sentences can be found that demonstrate that ``man'' is often
unintentionally used to exclude women:
<blockquote> David Moser once .... observed that in books you will find many
sentences in this vein: `Man has traditionally  been a hunter, and he
has kept his females close to the hearth, where they could tend his
children.'....  So much for the sexual neutrality of the generic
`man'.  I began to look for such anomalies, and soon ran across the
following gem in a book on sexuality: `It is unknown in what way Man
used to make love, when he was a primitive savage millions of years
ago' [<A HREF="node42.html#hofmet">Hofstadter 1986</A>, page 145,].
</blockquote>

<P>
In an approximately one month period of observation, I was able to
find many examples of people waffling on the issues of gender
nonspecific language at and around the MIT Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Lab.  I consider ambivalence more revealing than conforming to
the old ways, because it shows that many individuals are trying to
grapple with the issues but are unable to do so in a consistent manner.
These examples are presented not because the behavior was egregious
but to show the conflict within individuals:
<UL>
 <LI> A conference was held in one of the most male-dominated areas
of computer science.  Nevertheless, a few women played prominent
technical roles.  Relevant incidents were:
  <OL>
   <LI> A male attendee asked a female speaker: ``How many [pause]
engineer-years did this take?''  His pause was not sarcastic; he
evidently decided mid-sentence to use a neutral term instead of ``man-years''.
One guesses he would have used the latter term if asking the question
of a male.

   <LI> A female was introduced as a ``chairperson''
but, like the other (male) chairpeople, wore a ribbon that said
``chairman''. 
  </OL>

 <LI> During a talk, a professor showed a slide which said ``he/she''
for the generic computer architect, but said ``he'' when speaking.

 <LI> An announcement was sent to members of the AI Lab, containing ``I
am looking for a few brave men (or women) willing to help...'' 

 <LI> In a recent issue of a journal, a book reviewer referred to the
prototypical researcher as ``he'', parenthetically adding ``typically
he is a he''.<A NAME=tex2html22 HREF="footnode.html#515"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
</UL>
As mentioned above, the trait all these examples share is ambivalence.
Many people use neither the old way nor the new way but some mixture.
On such melanges, Douglas Hofstadter writes:
<blockquote> 
This is not progress, in my opinion.  In fact, in some ways, it is
retrograde motion, and damages the cause of nonsexist language.  The
problem is that these people are simultaneously showing that they
recognize that ``he'' is <i> not</i> truly generic and yet continuing to
use it as if it were.  They are thereby, at one and the same time,
increasing other people's recognition of the sham of considering
``he'' as a generic, and yet reinforcing the old convention of using
it anyway.  It's a bad bind [<A HREF="node42.html#hofmet">Hofstadter 1986</A>, page 150,].

<P>
<A NAME=secrev>&#160;</A>
Several writers, in order to argue for non-sexist writing, have
written essays with other biases than the traditional male/female
ones, and the results are (intentionally) shocking.  In this section,
I describe three such forays.
<P>
<UL><LI>
Douglas Hofstadter has written an essay ostensibly arguing for
traditional usages but from an imaginary standpoint with different
terms for whites and blacks analogous to those for men and women in
our culture.  For instance, ``white'' is used for ``whites and
blacks'' (as ``men'' is used for ``men and women''), and blacks have
different honorifics and pronouns.  Here is an excerpt of his (long)
essay:
<blockquote> Most of the clamor, as you certainly know by now, revolves around the
age-old usage of the noun ``white'' and words built from it, such as
<i> chairwhite</i>, <i> mailwhite</i>,...  The negrists claim that using
the word ``white'', either on its own or as a component, to talk about
<i> all</i> the members of the human species is somehow degrading to
blacks and reinforces racism.  Therefore the libbers propose that we
substitute ``person'' everywhere where ``white'' now occurs.
Sensitive speakers of our secretary tongue of course find this
preposterous.  There is great beauty to a phrase such as ``All whites
are created equal.''  Our forebosses who framed the Declaration of
Independence well understood the poetry of our language.  Think how
ugly it would be to say ``All persons are created equal'', or ``All
whites and blacks are created equal''.... [<A HREF="node42.html#hofmet">Hofstadter 1986</A>, page 159,]
</blockquote>

<LI>
Bobbye Sorrels Persing, in [<A HREF="node42.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>], has written a powerful
essay of an office scene with the male and female roles reversed.  Not
only are male workers called ``boy'' and ``sir chairwoman''
(corresponding to ``girl'' and ``madame chairman''), they are treated
and talked about as men stereotypically treat women who work for them
[<A HREF="node42.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>, pages 1--5,].
<P>
<LI>
A recent example exists in the computer world.  In <i> MacTech
Quarterly</i> (now <i> MacTech Journal</i>), ``she'' is used instead of
``he'' as the generic pronoun.  An editorial justified the policy and
announced that it would be used henceforth by the magazine
[<A HREF="node42.html#mactec">MTQ 1989A</A>].
</UL>
Further examples of reversing expectations appear in Section
<A HREF="node30.html#secrev2"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00534000000000000000> Reactions to Nontraditional Language</A></H2>
<P>
It is telling to look at the reaction to <i> MacTech Quarterly</i>'s
policy, printed in the issue following the editorial announcement [<A HREF="node42.html#mactec2">MTQ 1989B</A>].  A
follow-up article wrote that responses poured in, ``impassioned on
both sides''.  Some readers canceled their subscriptions, while others
pledged to buy as much as possible from the parent organization.  One
of the most interesting positive letters was from a female novice
programmer who wrote:
<blockquote> [A]s a woman who is a bit intimidated by her love of math and computers,
I deeply appreciate being able to open the MacTech Quarterly and have
the articles addressed to me, personally, a woman.
</blockquote>
Negative letters condemned the (male) editor for abusing his editorial
position.  One particularly angry writer repeatedly called into question
the editor's manhood: 
<blockquote> 
Ms. Hines,
<P>
You seem to be suffering from severe gender confusion.  As a private
matter, that's fine.  Everyone has their foibles.  But when it becomes
editorial policy it's offensive in the extreme....
<P>
When I feel like listening to emasculated male apologists I can always
turn on Donahue.  He's easy to turn off and I don't have to pay for
broadcasting his silly ideas.  So unless you will be adopting a more
well-thought-out policy, cancel my subscription and send my refund.  And
I will suggest MTQ adopt the subtitle, ``A Magazine for High Tech Women
and Eunuchs''.
<P>
If you've got even a dim memory of when you had balls, you'll print
this.
</blockquote>
(Note too the use of ``balls'', i.e. something women do not possess, as a
metaphor for fortitude.)  The letter illustrates that a man is
sometimes considered
to be a sell-out for taking a feminist position.  (While some men
praised the editor for his decision, apparently all of the harshest critics
were male.)  In addition to the above <i> ad hominem</i> letter, there
were more carefully-reasoned objections:
<OL><LI> Because of its long usage as the neutral pronoun, the sex of
``he'' is much less blatant than that of ``she''.
 <LI> Using the less grammatical ``they'' for the singular neutral
pronoun is a reasonable choice, particularly as it appears to have been
used centuries ago for this purpose.<A NAME=tex2html23 HREF="footnode.html#516"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
 <LI> Most of the readers of the magazine are male.
</OL>
Even in the most carefully-reasoned negative letter, however, the writer
expressed his intention not to renew his subscription.<A NAME=tex2html24 HREF="footnode.html#503"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>  This is clearly a point on which people have strong opinions.
<P>
In response to my call for information, a man wrote:

<blockquote> I'm the co-author of the [X] Guide;... One of the decisions that I made
was to remove all the sexist language, e.g. ``when the user types <i> his</i>
command'' sort of stuff.  It wasn't that hard to do, and I figured that
it was appropriate.
<P>
A couple of the reviewers ...  noticed this --- I suppose my prose
wasn't quite as seamless as I thought it was --- and commented on it.
They both suggested putting the male gender pronouns back in since
``most of the users are men, anyway''.  I didn't take this suggestion;
but what struck me was that these folks actually noticed the <i>
lack</i> of male pronouns.
</blockquote><H2><A NAME=SECTION00535000000000000000> Summary</A></H2>
<P>
Many people are not sure whether to use traditional or neutral terms.
The large number of mixed examples implies that people do not just
disagree with each other, but that individuals are unsure how best to
express themselves.  Additionally, many defenders of male terms do not
appeal to tradition or claim that the term is neutral, but they say
that the generic person would probably be male.  Thus, an empirical
rather than theoretical criterion is used, suggesting that the pronoun
would change if enough females entered the computer world.
