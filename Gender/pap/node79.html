While any well-intentioned person avoids behavior that they know to be
offensive, some people do not realize that certain behaviors,
discussed throughout this report, offend some women.  Good intentions
are no guarantee that women will not get the wrong message.  For
example, a woman might feel uncomfortable with a man who has revealing
pictures of women on his walls or computer screen.  Additionally, by
not using language that could be interpreted as sexist, such as ``he''
for the generic computer architect and terms like ``manpower'', women
feel more included.  One positive example is the name on a sample
application for the United States Department of Defense fellowships,
included in the instruction booklet: ``Smith, Dana Robin.''  Both
``Dana'' and ``Robin'' can be either female or male names.  Another
positive example is the alternating usage of ``he'' and ``she'' as the
default singular program in chapters of the influential <i> Computer
Architecture: A Quantitative Approach</i>, by John Hennessy and David
Patterson.  There are many guides to ``nonsexist'' communication, such
as [<A HREF="node93.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>].
<P>
Someone who supervises a research or work group or organizes its
events should try to choose activities at which all group members
would feel comfortable.  While it is not always possible to choose an
activity that everyone relates to --- for example, some people are
uninterested in any sport --- an effort should be made to include
everyone in at least some of the social occasions.  I have seen people
repeatedly left out of social activities springing from the workplace
because they are poor athletes or disabled, have unusual dietary
requirements, or do not drink alcohol.  Anyone who cannot socialize
with the group will not feel as though they fully belong.
(Conversely, anybody who does not want to socialize with the work
group, for whatever reasons, should not be made to feel unwelcome as a
worker.)
