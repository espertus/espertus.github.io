As mentioned earlier, many people consciously or unconsciously have
lower expectations of women.  This is exacerbated by affirmative
action.  If it is suspected (even falsely) that women can get jobs or
university positions with lower qualifications, people will be
suspicious of their skills.  Walter Williams, a black economist
opposed to affirmative action, writes about this phenomenon:
<blockquote> Today's quota policies raise real doubts in the eyes of many whites
who wonder whether some blacks have <i> earned</i> their status, or
whether they had it handed to them.  Like sickle cell anemia, this
`How do you know?' problem has become a sort of black man's disease.
<P>
It's not exclusively a black man's disease, however.  Women and others
who have been given special treatment also are victimized by it.
Recently, I had the occasion to take a short commuter flight.  Upon
boarding the aircraft, I saw a woman sitting in the right hand side of
the pilot's compartment.  There I was, faced with the `How do you
know' problem, with pretty high stakes in the balance.<A NAME=tex2html26 HREF="footnode.html#625"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</blockquote>
<P>
The recent press coverage of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas
shows how unreasonable people can be about quota programs.  Newspaper
after newspaper reported that, because Holy Cross College and Yale Law
School had aggressive minority quotas when Thomas was admitted, he
necessarily ``benefitted from minority preference admissions
policies''.<A NAME=tex2html27 HREF="footnode.html#626"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> The implicit
assumption is that, if a quota system was in effect, <i> none</i> of the
admitted blacks were qualified.  While some of the blacks may have
been unqualified, it would be ridiculous to assert that none were,
and, specifically, that Thomas was unqualified.  Additionally, as just
discussed, Yale's pre-quota admissions did not even purport to be
purely merit based.
