Only a small percentage of computer scientists and computer
professionals are female.  In the most recent years for which
statistics are available, women received a third of the bachelor's
degrees in computer science, 27% of master's degrees, and 13% of
PhDs.  Not only do women make up just 7.8% of computer science and
computer engineering faculties, only 2.7% of tenured professors are
female
[<A HREF="node42.html#frewom">Frenkel 1990</A>, page 38,] [<A HREF="node42.html#taulbee">Gries et al 1991</A>].  Even worse, these numbers seem to be
improving only very slowly or even dropping [<A HREF="node42.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 3,].
Many girls are still steered away from math and science or choose not
to pursue careers in these fields.  Additionally, many women who go into computer science are
conscious of being treated differently from men or feel that they
face additional barriers.  This report describes some of these
barriers.
<P>
As someone who has loved math and computers ever since I was a little
girl, I have always found it strange that so few females share these
interests.  At the computer camp I attended, the boy-girl ratio was
six to one.  It was similar at high school math club and the math
summer program I attended.  At MIT, only about 20% of the computer
science undergraduates are female, while other departments, such as
biology, are at least 50% female.  I researched this report to
explore why females so consistently stay away from computer science,
why people of both sexes seem to expect less from women, and why a
woman is considered unfeminine if she is an engineer.  Because math
and computer programming came easily to me and to many other women who
have had the opportunities, women clearly are not inherently unable to
do well in them.  Instead, girls and women are choosing, consciously
or subconsciously, not to go into or stay in computer science.  While
one cannot rule out the possibility of some innate neurological or
psychological differences that would make women less (or more) likely
to excel in computer science, I found that the cultural biases
against women's pursuing such careers are so large that, even if 
inherent differences exist, they would not explain the entire
gap.  In this paper, I describe the biases that women face in pursuing
careers in computer science and how they deal with them.
