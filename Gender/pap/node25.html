<P>
Not only can institutionalized special treatment be harmful, but so
can individual initiative.  Many instances exist of mixed
attempts to encourage women:
<UL>
<LI> A female professor taught an electrical engineering course and
announced that she especially wanted the women in the class to do
well.  During tests, she went around to the few women in the class and
would try to help them.  The female student I talked to said this
behavior made her very uncomfortable, and she felt that the men in
the class resented it.
<P>

<LI> A female computer science graduate student had these experiences:
<blockquote> My undergraduate advisor consistently encouraged me to go on to
graduate school, to apply for scholarships and fellowships, and
basically gave me a strong consistent message that I was good at this
stuff....[While I have had many bad experiences,] I have had a number
of friends, bosses, advisors, over the years who have been very
supportive, some seeming to disregard my gender, others aware of it
and patting themselves on the back for being so good about recognizing
my talent anyway.  The classic example of this is the well-meaning
professor who asks every woman student he has opportunity to talk
with, about whatever topic, `How are things here for you as a woman?'
</blockquote>
<P>

<P>

<LI> When a female computer science student visited a top graduate
school to which she had been admitted, she told me that a male
graduate student presented each of the women with a rose and told
each that he wanted her to come to that school.  When I heard 
this story, I asked a female graduate student in the department
whether this student was trying to sabotage female recruitment.  She
answered:
<blockquote> It turns out a bunch of people who were doing a lot of work on
organizing the recruiting weekend had decided, off the cuff, that they
thought this could be nice (as in:  what should we do with the leftover
roses).  So it wasn't this one grad student working on his own, and it
was not an attempt to sabotage recruiting.
<P>
	Its effect, however, was slimy and sabotaging.  As you note.  
Some of the women decided it was the one unsocialized nerd, others thought it
was strange but disregarded it, and others realized fully how totally
inappropriate it was even as the rose presentation was happening. 
One of these let the deliverer know, too, what she thought of it.
</blockquote></UL>
<P>
All these cases have in common that women are conscious of being
treated differently from men by someone who is trying to encourage
women.  Most women do not like this sort of treatment, although they
are grateful for encouragement when it is sincerely offered.
Nevertheless, it would also be wrong to suggest that professors not
encourage women if it does not come naturally to them and that
computer professionals should be as obnoxious to women as they often
are to men.  Additionally, people disagree on when special treatment
is positive and when it is negative.  For example, one woman objected
to there being a class entitled ``Women and Computers'':

<blockquote> I think the class is very poorly named, and I for one would <i> not</i>
sign up for such a course.  It assumes that women have
different/special issues with regard to computers than men have,
solely because of their gender.  This gives exactly the wrong message
to both men and the more `traditional' women.  What we as liberated
women <i> should</i> be doing is asserting over and over until we can
make it so that, except for a few basic physical differences that we
unfortunately can't deny (e.g., size and upper body strength), <i>
women and men are the same</i>.  By naming a course `Women and
Computers,' all you are doing is helping to perpetuate the myth that
women are somehow `different' and should be treated differently.
That's how we got where we are in the first place!<A NAME=tex2html29 HREF="footnode.html#576"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</blockquote>
<P>
This behavior is closely related to condescension, a problem described
in [<A HREF="node42.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>, page 9,], from which the following quotations are
taken:
<UL><LI> ``Often, when I ask a male graduate student how to do some
task, particularly something on the system, he will do it for me
rather than explain to me how I can do it for myself.''
 <LI> ``I asked a male graduate student a technical question and got
an answer that seemed to be aimed at someone with little or no
knowledge of computer science, as if it were being explained to a high
school student rather than a colleague.''
</UL>
Thus, in attempting to help women, people sometimes end up
implicitly insulting them.
