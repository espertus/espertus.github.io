<P>
One of the biggest misrepresentations of recent times is that
affirmative action is synonymous with lowered standards for favored
groups.<A NAME=tex2html25 HREF="footnode.html#522"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>  While some affirmative action programs do involve a
deliberate lowering of test scores required for entrance, many
programs do not.  The goal of many affirmative action programs is to
ensure that all applicants are considered in an unbiased manner.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00611000000000000000> The Need for Affirmative Action</A></H2>
<P>
As discussed in Section <A HREF="node7.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, women are often judged as less
qualified than men when their performance is identical.  For example,
in one controlled study, department chairs were given nearly identical
curricula vitae of supposed male and female applicants and asked to
recommend their faculty rank. They chose assistant professor if they
thought the applicant was a woman and associate professor if they
thought it was a man [<A HREF="node42.html#fidemp">Fidell 1975</A>].  The following examples show how
these contradictions are rationalized: 
<UL><LI> A man is described as `serving on two departmental committees
and <i> even</i> on one institutional committee,' while a woman with the
identical experience is noted as `serving on two departmental
committees but <i> only</i> on one institutional committee [<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page
6,].
<LI> A woman who has published only three articles is denied tenure.
(`Yes, the articles are high-quality, but she should have published
more than that in 5 years.')  Later, a man in the same department is
awarded tenure.  (`Well, he's a slow starter, but he shows a lot of
promise.')  [<A HREF="node42.html#lataca">Lattin 1984</A>, page 227,].
</UL>
These studies contradict the assumption that, without affirmative
action, all decisions are purely merit-based.  In fact, few would
dispute that ``before affirmative action programs were developed,
women were routinely turned down for many faculty and most
administrative positions, regardless of their credentials'' [<A HREF="node42.html#lataca">Lattin 1984</A>, page
228,].  For example, ``Gerty Cori, the first American woman
Nobel Prize winner (for medicine or physiology in 1947) ... was not
promoted to full professor until the year she won the prize''
[<A HREF="node42.html#huninv">Hunt 1991</A>].  See also [<A HREF="node42.html#gorwom">Gornick 1990</A>] and [<A HREF="node42.html#seldoe">Selvin 1991</A>, page 28,].
Clearly, something is wrong with the way people make
decisions, and they must bend over backwards to make sure they
consider each candidate equally.
<P>
College admissions were also frequently discriminatory before
affirmative action:
<blockquote> The admissions policy of the University of North Carolina, for
example, was openly discriminatory [until the early seventies]:
`Admission of women on the freshman level will be restricted to those
who are especially well qualified'....  The American Council on
Education reported that freshmen who entered four-year colleges in
1968 had widely divergent high school grades: more than 40 percent of
the girls had averages of B+ or better but only 18 percent of the boys
could boast the same.
<P>
The attitude of some male alumni certainly indicates that they would
find nothing at all strange in having disparate admission standards:
In congressional testimony in 1970, Ann Sutherland Harris reported the
following: `At Yale, when the new women undergraduates protested the
quota on women and made the modest demand for fifty more women
undergraduates the coming year at an alumni dinner, an alumnus was
cheered when he said: ``We're all for women, but we can't deny a Yale
education to a man.''' And when Harris was questioned by Congressman
William D. Hathaway of Maine on school admissions policies, the same
bias become apparent: `Mr. Hathaway: If you take the college
administration and they have so many kids that they can take into
school and they know that 90 percent of the men, for example, in our
society have to get a job, and, say, only 50 percent of the women are
going to get it, and they have a limited number they will take in,
aren't they warranted in taking nine out of ten men and fewer girls?'
[<A HREF="node42.html#abrinv">Abramson 1975</A>, page 74,]
</blockquote>
With attitudes like this, clearly some sort of program is needed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00612000000000000000> Distrust of Qualifications</A></H2>
<P>
As mentioned earlier, many people consciously or unconsciously have
lower expectations of women.  This is exacerbated by affirmative
action.  If it is suspected (even falsely) that women can get jobs or
university positions with lower qualifications, people will be
suspicious of their skills.  Walter Williams, a black economist
opposed to affirmative action, writes about this phenomenon:
<blockquote> Today's quota policies raise real doubts in the eyes of many whites
who wonder whether some blacks have <i> earned</i> their status, or
whether they had it handed to them.  Like sickle cell anemia, this
`How do you know?' problem has become a sort of black man's disease.
<P>
It's not exclusively a black man's disease, however.  Women and others
who have been given special treatment also are victimized by it.
Recently, I had the occasion to take a short commuter flight.  Upon
boarding the aircraft, I saw a woman sitting in the right hand side of
the pilot's compartment.  There I was, faced with the `How do you
know' problem, with pretty high stakes in the balance.<A NAME=tex2html26 HREF="footnode.html#625"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</blockquote>
<P>
The recent press coverage of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas
shows how unreasonable people can be about quota programs.  Newspaper
after newspaper reported that, because Holy Cross College and Yale Law
School had aggressive minority quotas when Thomas was admitted, he
necessarily ``benefitted from minority preference admissions
policies''.<A NAME=tex2html27 HREF="footnode.html#626"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> The implicit
assumption is that, if a quota system was in effect, <i> none</i> of the
admitted blacks were qualified.  While some of the blacks may have
been unqualified, it would be ridiculous to assert that none were,
and, specifically, that Thomas was unqualified.  Additionally, as just
discussed, Yale's pre-quota admissions did not even purport to be
purely merit based.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00613000000000000000> Low Self-Confidence</A></H2>
<P>
When women suspect (even falsely) that they have gained something
through affirmative action, their self-confidence often suffers.  One
female MIT student wrote:
<blockquote> As a freshman I was told I got into MIT because I was female.  When I
was a sophomore, people told me I would get into 6-A [the industry
co-op program] easier because I was female.  When I applied for
permanent jobs, I was told companies would hire me just because I was
female [<A HREF="node42.html#anohos">Anu 1990</A>].
</blockquote>
As noted in [<A HREF="node42.html#anohos">Anu 1990</A>], hearing such statements repeatedly can
harm a woman's self-esteem and cause her to question her ability.
<P>
No feminist I have spoken with has favored admitting less-qualified
women to university positions.  It is easy to see that, in addition to
breeding the distrust described above, admitting unqualified women
would, in general, be harmful to the people one wants to help:  If a
woman is admitted to a school for which she is not qualified, she will
probably be less happy and successful than if she attends an institute
for which she is qualified.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00614000000000000000> Uncritical Faith in Test Scores</A></H2>
<P>
Another point of confusion in the affirmative action debate is how
much weight to put on objective test scores.<A NAME=tex2html28 HREF="footnode.html#555"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
While many people assume that someone with lower SAT, LSAT, etc.,
scores is less qualified, this is not necessarily the case:
<blockquote> The SAT is marketed as a predictor of first-year college grades.  Yet
women, who earn higher first-year grades than men, score lower on the
SAT math and verbal section....
<P>
Moreover, women perform as well as, if not better than, men on New
York State's Regents exams for algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
Yet women consistently score lower than men on the SAT math section.
The manufacturers have no explanation why women score lower than men
on the SAT verbal section.  It is well known that females perform
better than males in high school English classes [<A HREF="node42.html#nytpoo">Horner et al 1990</A>].
</blockquote>
For example, statistical analysis done at MIT shows that although
male undergraduates have higher average board scores than female
undergraduates, women graduate at a higher rate than men and receive
grades that are just as high, even when adjusted for major.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00615000000000000000> Conclusion</A></H2>
<P>
While there is a need for affirmative action programs, they have large
negative effects that must be considered.  Even if a program does not
entail lower standards for women, doubts are cast on a woman's
qualifications in a society that already mistrusts them.  Programs
with lower qualifications may be a tactical mistake (in addition to
being unjust) because people may be put in situations for which they
are not qualified, giving them less overall success and
self-confidence than they would have had otherwise.  These negative
effects should be weighed when considering implementing an affirmative
action program.
<P>
As phrased in [<A HREF="node42.html#ernmat">Ernest 1976</A>, page 607,]:
<blockquote> We strongly support such affirmative action to ensure that all
potential female candidates are considered.  Such increased
recruitment efforts can only enlarge the list of qualified candidates
and thus result in the <i> raising</i> of standards.  To immediately
dispose of a red herring, let us state emphatically that none of us
believe a <i> less</i> qualified [scientist] should be hired, just
because she is female.
