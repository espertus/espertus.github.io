One consequence of increasing awareness of sexism is that women may
then expect it and treat men with more suspicion.  For example, at 
MIT, there were many cases of men misinterpreting women's friendliness
as expressions of romantic interest [<A HREF="node93.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>, page 14,].  While
women should know that their behavior could be misinterpreted, such
knowledge has negative effects as well:
<blockquote> Some women react by becoming wary of all new men they meet.  Thus,
some men are confronted with negative reactions from women to
seemingly innocuous, friendly overtures [<A HREF="node93.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>, page 4,]. 
</blockquote>
Men who have been overreacted to are likely to, on the basis of a
misinterpreted event, treat women's complaints with skepticism.
<P>
This phenomenon is also illustrated by the following letter from a 
male computer science student:
<blockquote> First, let nothing I say leave you with the impression that I don't
believe sexism or racism exists.  However, I think that many incidents
are incorrectly interpreted.
<P>
I am TAing the introduction to AI this semester.  After I graded and
returned the first assignment some woman and her boyfriend questioned
me about the grading.  Her grade was somewhat below his (about 5 out
of 30 points I think).  Her homework was one of the sloppiest ones in
the class, and probably deserved a lower score but I had been
instructed to grade generously for the first assignment.  Among her
arguments was something about how hard she had worked on it (there was
no evidence of hard work).  And something about how she and her
boyfriend had done it together.  Ignoring the possibility that this
was cheating (cooperation was not allowed) I felt that there was some
implication that she felt I was giving her a low grade because of her
gender....
<P>
Since then I have talked to her several times.  At first I think she
may have worried that my grading was gender biased, but I don't think
she now believes that.
<P>
By the way, I did a very rough check of my grading records some time
ago.  By sorting the class by average grade and eyeballing the result
I think that about <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img4.gif"> of the women are in each of the top,
middle, and bottom thirds of the class.

Also, there have been cases where women have gotten upset at unwanted
physical contact, such as being patted on the back by a man, before
finding out that he treats both men and women in that manner.  (Of
course, there are many more cases where men only try to touch their female
colleagues.)
<P>
Because of consciousness of discrimination, sometimes people who are
``obnoxious to everyone'' get falsely accused of sexism or racism.  
For example,
<blockquote> `General' harassment often takes a specifically sexist form when
applied to women....  Instead of saying to some average white male,
<i> `Your work on this project has been inexcusably sloppy, you
blinking idiot; you'll never make it that way!'</i>, the remark may come
out, <i> `My God, you think no better than my wife; why don't you go
home and have babies!'</i> [<A HREF="node93.html#rowbar">Rowe 1990</A>, page 159,]
</blockquote>
<P>
Additionally, reports and anecdotes are filled with anonymous examples
of sexist statements by male professors, staff, and students.  After
hearing such things, a female student has no idea which people around
her hold such disturbing attitudes and is likely to distribute her
distrust among the guilty and innocent alike.
