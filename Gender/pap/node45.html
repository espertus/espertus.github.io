Several writers, in order to argue for non-sexist writing, have
written essays with other biases than the traditional male/female
ones, and the results are (intentionally) shocking.  In this section,
I describe three such forays.
<P>
<UL><LI>
Douglas Hofstadter has written an essay ostensibly arguing for
traditional usages but from an imaginary standpoint with different
terms for whites and blacks analogous to those for men and women in
our culture.  For instance, ``white'' is used for ``whites and
blacks'' (as ``men'' is used for ``men and women''), and blacks have
different honorifics and pronouns.  Here is an excerpt of his (long)
essay:
<blockquote> Most of the clamor, as you certainly know by now, revolves around the
age-old usage of the noun ``white'' and words built from it, such as
<i> chairwhite</i>, <i> mailwhite</i>,...  The negrists claim that using
the word ``white'', either on its own or as a component, to talk about
<i> all</i> the members of the human species is somehow degrading to
blacks and reinforces racism.  Therefore the libbers propose that we
substitute ``person'' everywhere where ``white'' now occurs.
Sensitive speakers of our secretary tongue of course find this
preposterous.  There is great beauty to a phrase such as ``All whites
are created equal.''  Our forebosses who framed the Declaration of
Independence well understood the poetry of our language.  Think how
ugly it would be to say ``All persons are created equal'', or ``All
whites and blacks are created equal''.... [<A HREF="node93.html#hofmet">Hofstadter 1986</A>, page 159,]
</blockquote>

Bobbye Sorrels Persing, in [<A HREF="node93.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>], has written a powerful
essay of an office scene with the male and female roles reversed.  Not
only are male workers called ``boy'' and ``sir chairwoman''
(corresponding to ``girl'' and ``madame chairman''), they are treated
and talked about as men stereotypically treat women who work for them
[<A HREF="node93.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>, pages 1--5,].

<LI>
A recent example exists in the computer world.  In <i> MacTech
Quarterly</i> (now <i> MacTech Journal</i>), ``she'' is used instead of
``he'' as the generic pronoun.  An editorial justified the policy and
announced that it would be used henceforth by the magazine
[<A HREF="node93.html#mactec">MTQ 1989A</A>].
