<H2><A NAME=SECTION00311000000000000000> Background</A></H2>
<P>
Currently, most people in positions of power and respect are male.
Men are rhetorically asked in [<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page 3,]:
<blockquote> Imagine that your lawyer, your doctor, your priest, rabbi, or
minister, your Senator and Representative, your mayor, the president
of your institution, most of its trustees, almost all of the deans and
most of your colleagues were all women.  How would you feel?
</blockquote>
Not only are these positions held by men, but the media
propagate stereotypes of women.  A recent study found that ``women
are often still depicted on television as half-clad and half-witted,
and needing to be rescued by quick-thinking, fully clothed men''
[<A HREF="node42.html#nytwom">Adelson 1990</A>].  Whether or not people realize it, many of their
expectations of men and women are based on what they have observed and
by what messages their culture presents.  As one
Usenet<A NAME=tex2html4 HREF="footnode.html#44"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A> reader wrote:
<blockquote> This group [comp.society] has been discussing various stereotypes for
a long time now.  The problem is that we haven't acknowledged the
importance of stereotypes to human cognition.  We could easily call
stereotypes heuristics.  A heuristic is a device that allows a
processor to use some sort of knowledge to reduce a search.  In very
rough terms, stereotypes allow the wetware in our heads to do less
search when looking for evaluations of people and behaviors to events.
<P>
The human brain is the best known implementation of these heuristics.  In
fact the human brain is so reliant upon heuristics, that when presented
information that contradicts such a heuristic we feel confusion and
discomfort.
<P>
So where is all this going?  For better or worse, humans will continue to
make stereotypes based on input from their environment.  Since the average
person rarely meets programmers, and the only programmers that people see are
male geek actors on the TV, we will still have the geek image.  I have to
admit, most programmers I know are not ex-jocks.  Most programmers I know are
male, have interests in math and the insides of computers and will allow
their personal appearance to slip during those wonderful, coffee-filled,  
marathon programming sessions.  See, I have the disease too.

I believe that the author of the message is unusual not in having
biases but in being aware of them.  It has been empirically shown, as
will be described in the following sections, that many people expect
less of females without realizing it.  These stereotypes are not as
harmless as the author implies however, as they sometimes impair people
from seeing past the stereotypes.  Additionally, people tend to live
up or down to the expectations that are communicated to them.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00312000000000000000> Bias in Children's Toys and Computer Games</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME=sectoy>&#160;</A>
The social biases that influence females begin in childhood, where
boys and girls are often treated differently on the basis of sexual
stereotypes.  From the earliest ages, girls are given different types
of toys than boys.  For example, one study of children from one to six
years of age found:
<blockquote> Boys had more vehicles, toy animals, military toys, educational-art
materials, sports equipment, and spatial-temporal objects.  On the
other hand, girls had more dolls, doll houses, and domestic objects
[<A HREF="node42.html#rhetoy">Rheingold et al 1975</A>].
</blockquote>
The difference in toys cannot be explained purely by the children's
preferences --- the expectations of parents and other gift givers play
a major role.  Numerous studies, cited in [<A HREF="node42.html#pomenv">Pomerleau et al 1990</A>, page 360,] have found:
<blockquote> When interacting with an infant who was introduced as a girl, adults used
feminine toys (for instance, a doll) and talked more to `her'.  When
the infant was presented as a boy, they used masculine toys (e.g., a
hammer) and encouraged more motor activity.
</blockquote>
<P>
These stereotypes are perpetuated by toy companies, which market toys
in a stereotyped manner.  A 1969 <i> Life</i> ad contained:
<blockquote> Because girls dream about being a ballerina, Mattel makes Dancerina
... a pink confection in a silken blouse and ruffled tutu ... Barbie,
a young fashion model, and her friends do the `in' things girls should
do --- talk about new places to visit, new clothes to wear and new
friends to meet....  Because boys were born to build and learn, Mattel
makes Tog'l [a set of blocks for creative play]....  Because boys are
curious about things big and small, Mattel makes SuperEyes, a
telescope that boys can have in one ingenious set of optically
engineered lenses and scopes [<A HREF="node42.html#komima">Komisar 1972</A>, page 305,].
</blockquote>
While such an ad would not appear today, it indicates the environment
in which today's young scientists were raised.
<P>
As recently as 1985, a study found:
<blockquote> [T]he content of toy catalogues and the pictures of children on the
packages of toys are still strongly stereotyped.  In catalogues and in
stores, special sections are reserved for sex-stereotyped toys.  Girls'
sections contain dolls and accessories, doll houses, arts and crafts
kits, toy beauty sets, and housekeeping and cooking toys.  Building
sets, sports-related toys, transportation toys, workbenches and tools
are featured in the boys sections ([Schwartz et al 1985] in [<A HREF="node42.html#pomenv">Pomerleau et al 1990</A>, page
365,]).
</blockquote>
<P>
In addition to marketing toys in a stereotyped manner, such factors
influence the design of toys.  It was reported that:
<blockquote> Jaron Lanier, head of VPL, gave a talk at UIST in 1989 about his
experience productizing the data glove for Nintendo games....[H]e said
that [the] toy manufacturer was very strictly divided from the very
highest levels into the girl's toy division and the boy's toy
division.  He strongly resisted the glove from becoming either a
girls' toy or a boys' toy, but he lost.  He said that they immediately
categorized it as a boys' toy and put all kinds of black
Darth-Vader-ish, sports-car-like paraphernalia all over it to make it
appeal to boys.  He also said, had it been categorized as a girl's
toy, it probably would have been pink and frilly.
</blockquote>
Not only are there differences in varieties of ``old-fashioned'' toys given to
children, but these biases are carrying over into the realm of
computerized toys and games.  These games are both based on
traditionally male interests, such as war and sports, and are marketed
toward boys.  [<A HREF="node42.html#kiepoo">Kiesler et al 1985</A>, pages 456--457,] reports: 
<blockquote> On one rack [in a computer store], covers in comic-book style depicted
such games as Olympic Decathlon (4 male athletes on cover), Cannonball
Blitz (3 men in battle), Swashbuckler (9 male pirates), Thief (1 male
detective), Alien Typhoon (1 male space explorer) and Money Munchers
(1 man in a suit).  In all, 28 men and 4 women were illustrated on the
covers.  The women were on the covers of Monopoly (2 men and 2 women
playing the game), Palace in Thunderland (1 very fat queen), and
Wizard and the Princess (1 wizard standing, 1 princess in supplicating
position on floor).
</blockquote>
Girls' lesser usage of computer games could be a factor in their being
less positively disposed toward computers and in their lack of
interest in computer courses [<A HREF="node42.html#locwom">Lockheed 1985</A>, page 118,], particularly as
students who have played computer games are more likely to do well in
their first college computing course [<A HREF="node42.html#kiepoo">Kiesler et al 1985</A>, page 457,].
<P>
It should be noted that nobody with whom I have spoken proposes that a
conspiracy exists among manufacturers and advertisers to keep females
in their place.  Rather, companies aim their products at the largest
segment of the population that is predisposed to use them.
Additionally, females are more willing to buy products advertised for
males than vice versa [Courtney et al 1983].

<P>

Anecdotal evidence suggests that when an infant is dressed in blue,
passers-by say how smart he looks; if the same baby is dressed in pink,
people say how pretty she is.  Boys' clothing is often decorated with
cars and trains; girls' clothing rarely is.  More rigorously, numerous
studies of sex stereotyping of infants are reviewed in [<A HREF="node42.html#stesex">Stern et al 1989</A>],
including:
<blockquote> Parents in one study, for example, were asked to rate and describe
their newborns shortly after birth when the primary source of
information about the baby was his or her gender (Rubin et al., 1974).
Although the infants did not differ on any objective measures, girls were
rated as littler, softer, finer featured, and more inattentive than
boys.  Other studies have revealed that parents treat male and female
infants differently.... Fagot (1978) observed that parents of toddlers
reacted differently to boys' and girls' behaviors.  Parents responded
more positively to girls than boys when the toddlers played with
dolls, and more critically to girls than boys when the toddlers engaged
in large motor activity [<A HREF="node42.html#stesex">Stern et al 1989</A>, page 502,].
</blockquote>
Expecting different behavior from boys and girls can be a
self-fulfilling prophecy: If one sort of behavior is expected and
encouraged, the child will be more likely to continue it.
<P>
Children also have been shown to have formed sexual stereotypes as
early as at two years old [Weinraub et al 1983, page 33].  For example,
<blockquote> Preschool children also have a good grasp of adult-validated
sex-stereotyped beliefs about children's behavior.  When asked in an
interview-like situation which of two paper dolls --- `Michael' or
`Lisa' --- would like to do certain activities in nursery school,
end up in certain future roles, and have certain character traits,
children <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img1.gif"> to <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img2.gif"> years old showed an
impressive depth of knowledge (Kuhn, Nash, &amp; Brucken, 1978).  Children
believe that girls like to play with dolls, help mother, cook dinner,
clean house, talk a lot, never hit, and say `I need some help';
they also believe that boys like to play with cars, help father, build
things, and say `I can hit you' [<A HREF="node42.html#weisex">Weinraub et al 1983</A>, page 34,].
</blockquote>
The careers that children imagine for males and females are influenced
by sex stereotypes.  By the age of three years, most children ``know
that girls will grow up to clean the house, be a nurse, or be a
teacher, and boys will grow up to `be boss''' [<A HREF="node42.html#weisex">Weinraub et al 1983</A>, page 38,].
These stereotypes affect the careers that children picture for
themselves:
<blockquote> Even preschool children express future aspirations along
sex-stereotyped lines.  Both preschool and elementary school girls
choose a parenting role significantly more often than boys (Looft, 1971;
Vondracek &amp; Kirchner, 1974).  In addition, the range of occupational
choice is more restricted for girls, with nurse and teacher being the
most popular answers (Vondracek and Kirchner, 1974; Beuf, 1974).
Boys' choices include more action oriented occupations (police
officer, sports superstar) and more prestigious careers (doctor,
public servant, pilot).
<P>
Taking the question one step further, Beuf (1974) asked children 3 to 6
years of age what they would do if they were of the other sex.
Approximately 70 percent of the children replied with a job considered
appropriate for the imagined sex.  More interestingly, boys frequently
imagined themselves as nurses and girls imagined themselves as
doctors when asked, `What if you were a girl (boy)?'  Several girls
confided that they really would prefer to be doctors rather than
nurses when they grew up, but couldn't because they were girls
[<A HREF="node42.html#weisex">Weinraub et al 1983</A>, page 44,].
</blockquote>
Thus, from an early age, girls and boys learn to think of most careers
as being appropriate for either men or women but not both.  This will
influence not just their career choice but how they view males and
females aspiring to ``inappropriate'' roles.
<P>
Unfortunately, these stereotypes are so pervasive that it is difficult
for unprejudiced parents to prevent their children from accepting the
stereotypes:
<UL><LI> A female computer scientist told me:
<blockquote> 
We ... have a rather non-traditional household, and I'm surprised at how
traditional my two daughters seem to be turning out.
<P>
Both my husband and I work full-time, but when we are home, [John] does almost
all the cooking (I make a meal maybe once every three weeks), he cleans up
after himself while cooking so I don't do much of the cleaning in the kitchen,
I do the laundry (sometimes), and we let everything else go until a friend
comes to clean our house and dig us out from under the laundry I never can
seem to get to....
<P>
[Once,] I asked my 5-year-old who did most of the work around the
house, me or her daddy.  She said ``you''.  Now, this kid is totally
guileless --- she has not learned yet how to say one thing to one
person and another to another, so I'm sure she wasn't just telling me
this because I was the one who asked the question.  So I said, ``What
kind of work do I do around the house?  In the living room, in the
kitchen?''  She said, ``You clean the kitchen.''  <i> I couldn't
believe it!</i> I might have believed her if she said I occasionally
picked up in the living room --- but cleaned the kitchen?  Her dad's
domain?  Where did <i> that</i> come from????
</blockquote>
<LI>
Another parent reported:

<blockquote> When our daughter was very young --- about 3 years old --- we
audiotaped an interview about what she would be when she grew up.
After mentioning a number of possibilities my wife said, `What about a
doctor?'  Jessica replied, `Yeah, I could be a doctor.'  Our son who
was 5 at the time interrupted saying, `I think you mean a nurse.`
`Yeah, a nurse,' Jessica said.  My wife said, `She could be a doctor
if she wanted,' and our son replied, `I don't think so...I've never
seen any, at least not in Iowa.'
</blockquote></UL>
<P>
Stereotypes also exist specific to the computer world.  One paper reports:
<blockquote> We have even found that some young children believe computer games and
computers are for boys.  In one nursery school, Pratto (1982) asked
girls and boys aged 3 to 5 to name the toys they played with.  Both
girls and boys reported that boys played with Atari; it was never
mentioned as a game for girls.  We returned to that school and asked
42 children whether they thought computers were for girls, and then we
asked whether computers were for boys.  Most children answered this
question.  Although the majority thought computers were for both
genders, the boys were not as sure of this as were the girls (71% of
the girls and 57% of the boys).  Of the minority, more children
thought computers were for boys only (14% of the boys and 11% of the
girls) than thought computers were for girls only (7% of the boys and
4% of the girls) [<A HREF="node42.html#kiepoo">Kiesler et al 1985</A>, page 456,].
</blockquote>
<P>
The point of this section can be illustrated by the following incident:
<blockquote> A group of parents arranged a tour of a hospital for a group of
twenty children: ten boys and ten girls.  At the end of the tour,
hospital officials presented each child with a cap: doctors' caps for
the boys, nurses' caps for the girls.  The parents, outraged at this
sexism, went to see the hospital administration.  They were promised
that in the future, this would be corrected.  The next year, a similar
tour was arranged, and at the end, the parents came by to pick up
their children.  What did they find, but the exact same thing --- all
the boys had on doctors' hats, all the girls had on nurses' hats!
Steaming, they stormed up to the director's office and demanded an
explanation.  The director gently told them, `But it <i> was</i>
totally different this year: We offered them all <i> whichever hat
they wanted</i>'&quot; [<A HREF="node42.html#hofmet">Hofstadter 1986</A>, page 156,].
</blockquote><H2><A NAME=SECTION00314000000000000000> The Effects of Stereotypes on Teachers and Advisors</A></H2>
<P>
Additionally, stereotypes influence people who advise students, such
as their parents, guidance counselors, and teachers.  For example, [<A HREF="node42.html#steeff">Stewart et al 1989</A>] showed
that, when given artificial case studies, high school teachers were
more likely to advise male students than otherwise-identical female
students to take courses that would prepare them for post-secondary
institutions.   Another study showed that high school girls ``said that
they had chosen business and commercial courses in order to prepare
themselves for clerical jobs because they believed these were the jobs
open to women'' [<A HREF="node42.html#steeff">Stewart et al 1989</A>, page 261,].  In response to a survey of
female scientists,
<blockquote> [M]any women felt they had been given inadequate advice on careers and
choices of subject --- careers advisers seemed to be fixated on
nursing and teaching, and some were completely floored by requests for
information about nuclear physicists or process engineers [<A HREF="node42.html#fertru">Ferry et al 1982</A>, pages
27--28,].
</blockquote>
Interviews with high school guidance counselors yielded similarly
prejudiced advice to girls:
<blockquote> A counselor in her early 30's: `Well, if they bring me their
registration card with (an AP [advanced placement] science course)
listed I'll check to see if that's really what they meant... but I
would never encourage it.  I mean, it's usually their last year and
there are so many fun things going on.  I think they'll be busy enough
and they can get into the serious work in college.'
<P>
A counselor in her 20's: `I just hate to see a girl get in over her
head.  I always try to place students at a level where I know they'll
be successful.  I mean, wouldn't it be frightful to spoil a beautiful
record by doing poorly in a course your senior year.'
<P>
A male director of guidance, mid-forties: `Sure, I'm for the AP
Program in general, but not for encouraging girls in science
necessarily.  Have you looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics?  It's
a contracting market.  There are men with Ph.D.'s in physics all over
the place who can't get jobs.  Why should we encourage girls?  Why, if
they're successful, they'd be taking jobs away from men who need them.
No, it wouldn't be fair to the girls' [<A HREF="node42.html#cashel">Casserly 1979</A>, page 12,].
</blockquote>
Unfortunately, as the interviewer goes on to report,
``these comments were chosen not because they were unique but because
they represented all too commonly the attitudes of the counselors in
many schools''.
<P>
Additionally, even when girls are in science classes, teachers
sometimes treat them differently, as shown by the following remarks
from an interview of junior high school girls:
<blockquote> So this teacher came down from the high school to give a
demonstration in physics and said, `Now this is going to make a pretty
big noise, so any of you girls who don't like loud noises better cover
your ears.'
<P>
He said, `Now this is going to be dirty so we'd better have a
boy do it.'
<P>
And he (a high school science teacher performing a demonstration to a
sixth-grade class) said, `Now this will help you boys who fix your own
bicycles, so pay attention!'<A NAME=bikes>&#160;</A>
</blockquote>
(See also [<A HREF="node42.html#nytyuc">Marriott 1991</A>] and [<A HREF="node42.html#halcla">Hall 1982</A>].)
The girls then go on to describe the difficulties they had in getting
their parents to buy them tinker toys and chemistry sets, which are
routinely bought for their brothers [<A HREF="node42.html#cashel">Casserly 1979</A>, page 9,].
