Because many contributors wished to remain anonymous, I cannot thank
them by name.  I am pleased, however, to have this opportunity to
acknowledge <a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/sturkle/Turkle-HomePage.html">Prof. Sherry Turkle</a>, who encouraged me and supervised the
early stages of this project, and my friend Nate Osgood for his
support and thoughtful comments.  Additionally, I am grateful to
Dr. Vicki Almstrum, Danielle Bernstein, Joost Bonsen, David Chaiken,
Prof. Judy Goldsmith, Prof. Eric Grimson, Dana Henry, Magdalena Leuca,
Prof. Barbara Liskov, Prof. Nancy Leveson, Dr. Fanya Montalvo, Philip
Spertus, Prof. Lynn Stein, Becky Thomas, Christine Tsien, Dr. Kim
Wallen, Janet Wixson, Liz Wolf, and Mary Ellen Zurko for their
comments on earlier versions of this paper.  I am also grateful to
Dr. Anita Borg for managing an electronic mailing list of female
computer scientists and to the women on the list who have helped and
encouraged me.  Finally, I want to express my appreciation of the many
students, staff, and professors at MIT, particularly in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, who have been wonderfully supportive
of this work, especially EECS department head Prof. Paul Penfield, CS
head Prof. Fernando Corbat&#243;, MIT ombudsperson Prof. Mary Rowe, and
EECS administrator Marilyn Pierce.  Part of this work was done while I
was receiving financial support through a NSF graduate fellowship.
