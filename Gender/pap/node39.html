People's reactions to these facts vary.  Some people conclude that it
justifies women's lack of participation in traditionally-male fields.
However, powerful arguments exist against taking such a stand:
<blockquote> [B]iological factors cannot be the complete answer.  In other
countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, large numbers of women
study science successfully, despite any biological handicap.  Nor are
biological predispositions necessarily relevant when formulating
education policy.  Girls usually score better than boys on verbal
tests, and boys have more difficulty than girls in learning to read.
But schools do not take this as a reason for letting boys drop out of
reading classes.  Quite the reverse: most schools have remedial
reading classes which are used predominantly by boys.  Teachers put
extra effort into teaching boys to read to make up for any deficiency,
whether its origin is biological or social.  The same could be done to
boost the spatial ability of girls if the problems were considered
equally serious [<A HREF="node42.html#kelwhy">Kelly 1982</A>, page 497,].

Additionally, the field of feminist technology argues that technology
can legitimately be taught in a manner that plays more to women's
strengths, be they biological or environmental, not relying so heavily
on fields like mathematics in which men currently outperform women.
For example, Sherry Turkle and Seymour Papert found:
<blockquote> When we looked closely at programmers in action we saw formal and
abstract approaches; but we also saw highly successful programmers in
relationships with their material that are more reminiscent of a
painter than a logician.  They use concrete and personal approaches to
knowledge that are far from the cultural stereotypes of formal
mathematics [<A HREF="node42.html#turepi">Turkle et al 1990</A>, page 128,].
</blockquote>
Student programmers with the less mathematical style, sometimes men
but usually women, are discouraged when in classes that force a more
mathematical approach [<A HREF="node42.html#turepi">Turkle et al 1990</A>, pages 131-132,].  Turkle and
Papert advocate ``epistemological pluralism'', in which different
approaches are allowed to flourish.  Similarly, Sally L. Hacker argues
convincingly that more mathematics than necessary is required by
engineering programs, weeding out students who would be able to
succeed as engineers if they did not have to pass timed calculus exams
[<A HREF="node42.html#hacmat">Hacker 1983</A>].  As one female computer science professor writes:
<blockquote> [T]here's a committee at the [X] engineering school trying to redesign
the school-wide common core curriculum, for freshman and sophomore
years.  I asked our department's representative to the committee to
bring up that the current common core tends to discourage females and
minorities because it's too heavily math and engineering oriented (and
most of these courses are not needed for CS), and does not provide
options to take courses in more people-oriented fields (that are
relevant to CS) such as psychology.  Apparently the committee chairman
said to our representative something to the effect that it is not the
mission of this committee to address women and minorities, and thus he
would not put this issue on the agenda.
