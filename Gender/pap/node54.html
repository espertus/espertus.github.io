Another point of confusion in the affirmative action debate is how
much weight to put on objective test scores.<A NAME=tex2html28 HREF="footnode.html#555"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
While many people assume that someone with lower SAT, LSAT, etc.,
scores is less qualified, this is not necessarily the case:
<blockquote> The SAT is marketed as a predictor of first-year college grades.  Yet
women, who earn higher first-year grades than men, score lower on the
SAT math and verbal section....
<P>
Moreover, women perform as well as, if not better than, men on New
York State's Regents exams for algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
Yet women consistently score lower than men on the SAT math section.
The manufacturers have no explanation why women score lower than men
on the SAT verbal section.  It is well known that females perform
better than males in high school English classes [<A HREF="node93.html#nytpoo">Horner et al 1990</A>].
</blockquote>
For example, statistical analysis done at MIT shows that although
male undergraduates have higher average board scores than female
undergraduates, women graduate at a higher rate than men and receive
grades that are just as high, even when adjusted for major.
