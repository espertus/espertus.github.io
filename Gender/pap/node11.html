<P>
At the workplace, many women feel uncomfortable with the ``locker room
atmosphere'', which includes pictures of nude or partially nude women
on posters or computer screens and the telling of dirty jokes.  Unlike
the sexist remarks described above, however, there is disagreement
among women on how inappropriate these actions are, with a significant
number of women not personally offended by the behavior (although some
of these women oppose it on the grounds that it upsets other women).
This point is illustrated by the different reactions in the following
examples:
<UL>
<LI>
When a graduating engineer was touring a company that wanted to hire
her, they took her through the laboratory, which had a pin-up
on the wall.  The
other people in the lab (men) and the men showing her around seemed
oblivious to the poster and to her discomfort.  She felt 
uncomfortable with the idea of working in a laboratory with a picture
like that up and ended up refusing the offer, partly for this reason.
<P>

<LI>
When a graduating computer scientist was taken out to lunch by engineers
of a small computer company, one of the topics the
employees (all male) discussed was a series of lingerie shows in the
region.  The student did not feel uncomfortable about the subject
matter, and it did not affect her decision about the company, but she
thought it was something which might make other female interviewees
uncomfortable.
<P>

<LI>
When a computer science undergraduate had recently begun working in a
research group at her university, some male graduate students entered
the office and began playing an ``adult'' computer game, ``Leisure Suit
Larry,'' crowding around the screen, discussing the game loudly.
The undergraduate left the office because the situation
made her too uncomfortable for her to work there.  When she recounted
the story a year later, she said that she would not react the same way
now and would either be able to keep working or would say, ``Hey, get
out of here, guys.''  The change was due to her feeling more confident
about her position in the group and knowing the individuals
personally.
</UL>
<P>
One female computer science student explained one reason that some
women are offended by sexual humor while others do not understand what
the fuss is about:
<blockquote> 
I have noticed that how offended I am by [gender-related humor] depends very
strongly about how comfortable it is to be female and in the present
environment.
<P>
When I first entered grad school in the CS [X] group at [Y], there
were some women graduate students, but only a couple. A secretary
deliberately placed me, when I arrived, sharing a desk with a male
graduate student who was at that time desperately trying to find a
woman (she was trying to be nice) --- a professor had a `funny'
newspaper article about [a sexual topic] posted outside his door.
Don't get me wrong, I found nearly no-one among the faculty and
graduate students who was anti-women or took me or my work or my
concerns any less seriously than any other first-year student. Still,
the graduate students were 90 percent men, and they talked all the
time about how hard it was to meet `available' women, and as a first
year student trying to establish myself within their community, I
found the `locker room' atmosphere oppressive and daunting. If someone
had sent around [a sexist joke through email] that year, I think I
would have hit the roof. In a world where I was struggling to find my
place, it would have just helped to undermine it.
<P>
Today the graduate student population in CS [X] has quite a few more
women, and is much more comfortable. Instead of the ``guys'' in school here,
it's the `people' in school here....  In my current environment I
might have easily [passed along the joke] to my [male] office-mate.
</blockquote><H2><A NAME=SECTION00422000000000000000> Attempts at Changing Behavior</A></H2>
<P>
Some computer science graduate students and staff at Carnegie Mellon
were sufficiently disturbed by the display of nude pictures as
backgrounds on computer terminals that they got together and tried to
change the situation by publicly appealing to the community.
[<A HREF="node42.html#cmudea">CMU 1989</A>] is a fascinating report describing their appeal and the
friendly and hostile reactions.  Their appeal included the following
passage:
<blockquote> When a woman sees such a display on your workstation, is she likely to
believe that you take her seriously as a fully contributing member of
the department?  Rather, she may feel that you could be a source of
sexual harassment, and feel hostile towards you, or nervous about
working with you.  If so, that is a loss for you, for her, and for all
of us.  Among the visitors to the department, some of whom are
prospective students, staff, or faculty, there are surely some who
will view us as unprofessional if they see these displays, and this
hurts us all, too.  Conversely, an environment more hospitable to
women --- specifically, one in which relations between women and men
are less strained --- is of clear benefit to men as well.
<P>
For some people, displays of naked women on workstations, or elsewhere
in offices, remind them of the forces in our culture that view women
as sexual playthings, not as men's peers.  For others, such reactions
do not occur.  People who are offended will interpret such displays as
derogatory, even if that is not your intent.  We therefore ask you to
refrain from using them out of respect for those who are offended,
even if you believe the offended people are just overly sensitive
[<A HREF="node42.html#cmudea">CMU 1989</A>, page 2,].
</blockquote>
The appeal closed by making clear that they were not advocating
banning such displays but were requesting that people voluntarily
remove them out of sensitivity to others.  Responses about the
appropriateness of the displays and of the appeal were mixed and are
categorized in the report.  Negative reactions included the position
that the writers were advocating censorship ``like the Nazis or the
Ayatollah Khomeini,'' that people should not be asked to change their
behavior merely because of what others might think, and that a public
appeal was inappropriate but instead should have been made by
individuals to individuals.  Of those agreeing, the majority of
responses said that the request was reasonable and not an attempt at
censorship, that it prevented people from unintentionally giving
offense, and that it was effective at raising consciousness.  In
response to the criticism that individuals should complain personally,
several women wrote that ``[w]omen asking for changes in behavior
individually are exposed to ridicule and abuse'' [<A HREF="node42.html#cmudea">CMU 1989</A>, page
4,].  This point was echoed by a woman quoted in a paper about
the ``Garden'', a laboratory in the MIT Media Lab:
<A NAME=secfem>&#160;</A>
<blockquote> [W]hen comments are made about the offensive nature of the music or
movies, they are often ignored, or belittled, or are chortled at.
Ironically, once you are labeled a feminist in the Garden, your
comments are taken less seriously, because you are considered radical
and your judgment less fair [<A HREF="node42.html#tidhac">Tidwell 1990</A>, page 14,].
</blockquote>
Both the Carnegie-Mellon and Garden papers conclude that the
attempts at changing people's behavior were somewhat, but not
highly, successful.
