<P>
The recommendations are divided into four categories: programs that
could encourage women in technical fields, ways for women to build
their self-image as scientists, ways for women to deal with biased
behavior, and suggestions for men and women who wish to encourage
women in the sciences.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00711000000000000000> Programs and Policies to Encourage Women</A></H2>
<P>
Programs that could be implemented to encourage women are discussed by
[<A HREF="node42.html#keinat">Keith et al 1990</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>], and interested readers are urged to
read the full suggestions in these documents.  Many of the following
suggestions are from these sources.   While the suggestions are geared
to universities, most can be adapted to industry as well.  Recommended
actions are:
<UL><LI> 
<i> Making clear that sexual harassment will not be tolerated.</i>  
Individuals in supervisory positions, such as professors or
managers, should make it clear that they will not tolerate sexual
harassment.  Not only would this discourage such behavior, but
harassed females presumably would feel more comfortable reporting any problems
that do occur to supervisors who have made it clear that they are
aware of the possibility of sexual harassment and want to fight it.

<P>
One way an EECS department head did this was by
announcing during a graduate orientation session that sexual
harassment was unacceptable and that any harassment victims or
witnesses should alert someone in a position of authority.
See [<A HREF="node42.html#rowhar">Rowe 1981</A>,<A HREF="node42.html#rowdea">Rowe 1985</A>] for advice on implementing effective
programs to fight sexual harassment.
<P>
<LI> <i> Educating all members of the academic community --- including
board members, administrators, faculty, students, and staff --- about
professional climate issues; the various forms differential treatment
takes; and the institution's commitment to ensure equitable treatment</i>
[<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page 17,].  One way many schools do this is by teaching
about subconscious discrimination when training graduate students to be
TAs.
<P>
<LI> <i> Establishing a dialogue with women in the department to make sure
their concerns are being communicated and addressed.</i> Many women have
given thought to how their department could be improved but are never
asked.
<P>
<LI> <i> Regularly gathering data by sex, race, and age</i> covering areas such
as salary, benefits, promotional analyses, special perquisites, awards,
grants, courseload, advising load, committee assignments, and so on to
determine if men and women at all ranks and within all units are
treated equitably with regard to responsibilities and rewards
[<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page 18,].
<P>
<LI> <i> Making equitable treatment of women and minorities part of the
formal reward structure.</i>  For example, when evaluating performance,
give commendations to individuals and extra positions to departments
that excel in this area [<A HREF="node42.html#sancam">Sandler 1986</A>, page 19,].
<P>
<LI> <i> Providing a method for individuals to turn off the tenure
clock so they can have children without sacrificing their career.</i>
<P>
<LI> <i> Providing opportunities for professors to serve as mentors to
students or for graduate students to mentor undergraduates.</i>
<P>
<LI> <i> Making sure that female students are involved in research.</i>
Much of the information about research opportunities, particularly at
the undergraduate level, is communicated informally, and some students
may be left out.  Additionally, if pre-college experience is a
prerequisite for undergraduate research, women and minorities, who
tend to enter with less experience, may fall further behind.  This
could be avoided by informing students what knowledge is needed for
interesting jobs and encouraging them to take such classes early, or
by setting aside money for research groups that are willing to provide
training.
</UL><H2><A NAME=SECTION00712000000000000000> Ways for Women to Build Self Image</A></H2>
<P>
As described throughout this report, being a woman in computer science
is unusual in that the majority of one's peers are male
and many people, consciously or subconsciously, expect the men to
perform better.  These expectations are subtly communicated to both males
and females.  Fortunately, there are many ways that a woman can
increase her self-confidence and her self-image as a computer scientist.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00712100000000000000> Attending Classes with Other Women</A></H3>
<P>
A female computer science student often find herself in a classes
where she is one of the only women.  Additionally, she
is likely to have few, if any, female professors.  Even in the
absence of being treated differently, this is likely to affect a
student's self-image and perceptions of women.  In reality, females in
coed classrooms are usually treated differently from the males:
<blockquote> [T]eachers praise boys more than girls, give boys more academic help
and are more likely to accept boys' comments during classroom
discussions...  While girls sit patiently with their hands raised,
boys literally grab teacher attention.  They are eight times more
likely than girls to call out answers ([<A HREF="node42.html#sadsex">Sadker et al 1985</A>] in [<A HREF="node42.html#nosgen">Van Nostrand 1990</A>, page
187,]).
</blockquote>
(See also Section <A HREF="node7.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.)  By taking classes at women's
colleges or in women's studies, which almost always have a
large majority of women, female students feel free to more actively
participate in the classroom and are taken more seriously by teachers
and other students.  While advising technical females to consider
single-sex high schools and colleges may appear counter-intuitive,
particularly because these schools often have less adequate laboratory
facilities, studies have shown that females at single-sex schools
study more science and mathematics than those in coeducational schools
[<A HREF="node42.html#kelwhy">Kelly 1982</A>, page 499,], are more likely to continue in science
[<A HREF="node42.html#fertru">Ferry et al 1982</A>, page 27,], and are disproportionately successful
compared to other women [Gilbert et al 1983].
<P>
Another advantage of women's studies programs is their emphasis on
women's achievements.  One female computer science student had the
following experience:
<blockquote> When I entered my first women's studies class, on literature written
by women, I expected to encounter second-rate works that were only
being taught when the ground rules eliminated male competition.
Instead, the books were first-rate, and I wondered why I had never
read them before.  The class taught me that women's achievements had
often been overlooked.  (I had been pretty misogynic before that.)
</blockquote>
Because of men's numerical and figurative dominance in engineering
classes, a student in a women's studies course can find herself
listening to vocal female students for almost the first time since
entering college.
<P>
Another benefit of women's studies programs is that they document the
barriers women have faced.  It is important for women to realize that
the paucity of women in the field does not imply that women are
inherently unable and that negative behavior they encounter may be due
to their sex and not to any actual shortcomings on their parts.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00712200000000000000> Female Role Models</A></H3>
<P>
Finding female role models and mentors can also be helpful to a
woman's self-image.  While male mentors are certainly useful, and many
women are happy with male advisors, female role models serve the
additional purpose of providing a living example of a successful
female scientist.  One study found that ``[f]emale graduate students
who identified female professors as role models viewed themselves as
more career oriented, confident, and instrumental than did female
students identifying male role models'' [<A HREF="node42.html#gilsex">Gilbert et al 1983</A>, page 597,],
although, as the report notes, self-selection may also have been a
factor [<A HREF="node42.html#gilsex">Gilbert et al 1983</A>, page 605,].  As noted in [<A HREF="node42.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 20,]:
<blockquote> The importance of mentoring and role models cannot be stressed too
much.  One female student ... wrote about her experience in a summer
job working for a female manager who she described as: `one of the
most respected people in the company.  I had never expected that
having a female role model would change the way I felt about myself,
but it did'.
</blockquote>
Thus, a female student should consider finding a senior woman in her
field  to work for at school or during a summer job.  While a
person's sex should not be the primary factor in choosing a mentor,
spending some time with a female role model can be psychologically
beneficial.  (See also [<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, pages 104--109,].)
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00712300000000000000> Women's Groups</A></H3>
<P>
In part because female computer science students so outnumber female
professors, one-to-one contact is not always possible.  Many schools
have get-togethers for women in computer science or engineering,
ranging from informal annual meetings to regular meetings of the
Society of Women Engineers.  Women find these activities useful for
receiving encouragement and advice, and they ``generate a lot of good
feeling'' [<A HREF="node42.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 23,].
<P>
Perhaps the most effective group currently existing for women in
computer science is an electronic mail discussion group with over
seven hundred members which provides women with a ``forum for
discussion of both the problems and joys of women in our field and a
medium for networking and mentoring'' [<A HREF="node42.html#frewom">Frenkel 1990</A>, page 36,].  Women
share advice on female-specific topics such as the best time in one's
career to have children, how to dress for conferences, and how to deal
with sexism, as well as general-purpose networking.  The list is
particularly important to women in computer science because they are
so dispersed and might not otherwise be able to interact with many
other female computer scientists and engineers.  Being part of a
discussion group with hundreds of female computer scientists can
change a woman's default image of a computer scientist from male to
female (or neutral) --- quite a difference from a student's academic
experience, where two thirds of the computer science departments have
zero or one female professors [<A HREF="node42.html#taulbee">Gries et al 1991</A>].
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00713000000000000000> Ways for Women to React to Biased Behavior</A></H2>
<P>
In cases of blatant sexual harassment, a woman can usually complain to
some authority.  In less clear-cut but nevertheless offensive
situations, this option is often not open.  While acting as a group
and writing a report was effective for women at MIT [<A HREF="node42.html#wombar">MIT 1983</A>] and
Carnegie-Mellon [<A HREF="node42.html#cmudea">CMU 1989</A>], often women must react individually to
behavior they find unacceptable.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00713100000000000000> Reacting to Subtle Discrimination</A></H3>
<P>
As discussed in Section <A HREF="node7.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, women are often the victims of
subtle subconscious bias.  For example, a woman may find that comments
are primarily directed to men in a group, unintentionally leaving her
out.  If the woman does not feel comfortable directly confronting the
individuals in question, there are more diplomatic methods of calling
the behavior to the person's attention: 
<UL>
 
<LI> In a meeting of three computer science students, the sole
female found herself ignored by one of the male participants.
Whenever she asked him a question, he directed his answer to the other
male present.  (See page <A HREF="node7.html#parcmu"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> of this report.)  After the
meeting, the woman took him aside and mentioned that she had noticed
he had directed his answers to [John] and asked, in a concerned way,
whether she had done anything to cause this behavior.  When he replied
that she had not done anything wrong and began to apologize, she
dismissed his apologies by saying that she was just relieved she had
not given him any negative signals.  He continued to apologize.
<P>
The indirectness of her approach allowed the man to save face while
still communicating the point.  It appears to have been effective,
because, when she saw the man later in the day, he made eye contact
and spoke directly to her.
<P>

<LI> At a social occasion, a young woman found that a male relative
directed serious discourse almost exclusively to her brother and not to her.
When the woman was alone with the relative, she said to him, `I hope
I haven't given you the idea I'm not interested in your opinions on
[X].  I noticed you directed your comments about it to [John].  I
want you to know I am interested in what you have to say on the
subject.'  The male relative replied, sincerely, that he had not
realized she was interested in the topic and would include her in the
future.
</UL>
While some people might object to these oblique methods, as they
involve the victim's pretending to put the blame on herself, they are effective
in situations where the woman does not feel comfortable being more
direct, and they often elicit an apology.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00713200000000000000> Reacting to Overtly Sexist Comments</A></H3>
<P>
Indirect methods are also often more effective than direct means for
dealing with offensive sexist and sexual comments.  As mentioned in
Section <A HREF="node11.html#secfem"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, the only consequence of complaining is often
that one is dismissed as a `feminist'.  In a recent column in <i> The New
York Times</i>, a woman described her experience as a college journalist:
<blockquote> Though I was militantly middle of the road in perspective, by the
second time I mentioned sexism in print I was pegged.  People I met
seemed to treat me like a Marxist, a radical, a testosterone-fueled
male-basher; others asked me why I suddenly hated men so much; and
certain folks at home warned me that I was going to jeopardize my
future by scaring off potential male suitors [<A HREF="node42.html#nytfem">Kamen 1990</A>].
</blockquote>
Two techniques that are often more effective than anger (even when
justified) are role reversal, which involves the substitution of
other terms for female terms, and humor.  Combinations of these two
techniques are especially effective.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=SECTION00713210000000000000> Role Reversal</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME=secrev2>&#160;</A>
Treating men in the manner in which they treat women can be an
effective response to poor treatment:
<UL><LI> One female computer scientist said: 
<blockquote> I'm much more often complimented for my dress, my hair, or my accent
than for the content of what I say and do.  So I just turn the
compliments around and tell men how pretty their ties are, or how the
cut of their jackets bring out their broad shoulders.  They squirm
under such scrutiny just as we do [<A HREF="node42.html#frewom">Frenkel 1990</A>, page 41,].
</blockquote>
<LI> 
  
    When a group of men were unable to understand why women in the
workplace were offended by posters of naked women, a woman put up a
huge picture of a naked man.  She was asked to take it down,
communicating her point.<A NAME=tex2html34 HREF="footnode.html#692"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot_motif.gif"></A>
</UL>
Substituting terms pertaining to race instead of sex can also be
effective:
 <UL><LI> Someone who does not understand why it is offensive to call a
grown woman ``girl'' should be asked whether they would call an adult
black male ``boy'', something that also used to be considered acceptable.
   <LI> A female computer scientist related the following story:
      <blockquote> 
[A few years ago,] I wrote to Time Magazine
to register my opinion about a `humor' piece titled `Women Are Getting Out of
Hand', which included lines like `Women are getting too big for their
britches'.  I suggested that they would not be likely to publish articles like
`Blacks Are Getting Out of Hand' or sentences like `Hispanics are getting too
big for their britches'.

<P>
      </blockquote></UL>
See also the passages in Section 3.3.3, which, while
impractical for conversation, also make the point.
<P>
<H4><A NAME=SECTION00713220000000000000> Humor</A></H4>
<P>
Humor is effective for several reasons.  First, when men make
offensive remarks, if someone protests, they retort: ``Can't you
take a joke?''  When a woman uses humor to protest an offensive
remark, she can offer the same response if challenged.  Additionally,
humor breaks tension and often allows one to point out that something
is wrong without a direct confrontation.
<P>

One female computer professional told the following stories:
<UL><LI>
Shortly after my appointment, my boss, V.P. of Administration, called a
meeting to discuss the problems of the center.  All of the attendees were
male and deans or equivalent high positions.  The discussion in that meeting
was quite heated with adamant remarks about the problems in computing on
campus.  Towards the end of the meeting, one of the attendees started
pounding on the table and reviewed the names of the previous male directors of
the center, ending with the comment, `No offense meant, [Jane], but we need
a man in this job.'  I responded with, `I'm willing to do almost anything
to fix the problems in the Computer Center, but a sex change operation is
out of the question.'
<P>
That turned out to be the perfect response --- I got my point across and it
broke the tension with laughter.  The moral of this story is, that if you
can make your point with humor, the message goes down easier.
<P>
<LI>
Another time, I received in the mail an advertisement from a company
that sells disk drives.  The advertisement was included in a box that
contained Havana cigars.  (Obviously, this company assumed that the
mailing list they had of CIO's were all men).  I wrote a letter to the
VP of marketing for the company telling him that I thought that one of
his competitors were trying to undermine the intelligence of his
marketing organization by sending cigars to female decision makers in
his company's name.  Two days later, I received a federal express
delivery from him --- it was a bottle of perfume with a letter of
apology.  I thought his response was a good recovery.
</UL>
A computer science professor told the following story:
<blockquote> [W]hen I first starting teaching 13 years ago, I was married at the
time and both my husband and I had teaching positions in the same
department.  My department head was sitting in my class (at the time
we were in a joint math and CS department and my department head was
retraining).  [O]ne day, one of my students referred to me as Mrs.
[Smith] in class and I was feeling pretty frustrated by that point
since I had noticed that I kept getting called `Mrs.' while my
husband was [called] `Dr.', so I looked at him and said `What do you 
call Karl?,' and he replied `Dr. [Smith]'.  So I told him that I'd
appreciate it if he would use the same title for me since I had the
same degree.  Well, he wasn't the type to quiet down quickly, so he
retorted, `And what does Karl think of your feeling that way?,' to
which I replied angrily, `It doesn't matter what he thinks; it was a
helluva lot harder to get a Ph.D. than it was to get married.'  Word
apparently got out to the students after that because I wasn't called
`Mrs.' for quite some time.  (Of course, I was shaking by the time
class ended wondering what my department head thought of that
reaction.  He never did say anything about it.) 
</blockquote>
<P>
Female computer scientists have combined the techniques, role reversal
and humor, as in the following incidents:
<UL><LI>
A female computer scientist reported:

<blockquote> A few years ago I was at a workshop held way out in the country....
There were about forty people there.  I don't remember how many were
women, but there couldn't have been many.
<P>
At one point we were sitting around singing, and after a while
someone started one of those make-up-a-verse of your own affairs....
It went around for a while, and someone offered,
<P> 
I know a girl, her name is Jill. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
She won't do it, but her sister will. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
  <P>
<P>
Well, I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but I co-opted the next verse:
<P> 
I know a guy, his name is Bill. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
He won't do it, but his brother will. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
  <P>
<P>
Everyone laughed, and I thought the matter was settled.  But some people
won't give up, and a few rounds later, the <i> same</i> fellow came around
with:
<P> 
I know a girl, her name is Sue. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
She won't do it for me, but she'll do it for you. <BR> 
        dum-de-dum de dum-dum-dum-dum <BR> 
  <P>
Drat!  Can't back down now ...   I got as far as:
<P> 
I know a guy, his name is Lou.... <BR> 
  <P>
when the <i> rest</i> of my colleagues shouted down the offender.
</blockquote>
<P>

<P>
<LI>
A female computer science graduate student reported the following incident:
<blockquote> A [campus] career recruitment poster, several years ago ...  made
quite a splash.  The poster portrayed two men in shirts and ties
picking up a printout off a line printer, dropping the fanfold paper
all over the floor as they ogled at a woman walking by in a miniskirt.
The caption: `We think about more than just work here at [Company
Name].'  Outraged women began tearing the posters off the walls, then
(insert light bulb here) they instead made photocopies and put them up
in great numbers all over campus.  Meanwhile, the recruiters figured
out something was wrong and tried desperately to get rid of them.  A
number of women went to the recruitment talk to disrupt it, and found
that they were the only ones there.  Several hack posters were
created, for example one with two women in businesslike garb poring
over a printout while a scantily clad beach-boy type walked by, with
the caption, `We think about more than just sex here at [Company
Name].'  I believe the president of the company issued a
formal apology afterward.  This one is notable as much for the
reaction of the student body as for the poster itself.
</blockquote></UL><H2><A NAME=SECTION00714000000000000000> Ways for Individuals to Encourage Women</A></H2>
<P>
Most of the suggestions in this section involve avoiding behavior that
was described elsewhere in the report as potentially offensive.
Because the reader is assumed to have read the rest of the report, a
minimum of justification appears in this section.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00714100000000000000> Fighting Subconscious Bias</A></H3>
<P>
As described in Section <A HREF="node7.html#secsub"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, many people treat men and women
differently without realizing it.  Once people understand that it is
possible for a well-meaning person to unintentionally discriminate,
they should train themselves to oversee or spot check their behavior
to make sure they do not behave in such a manner.  Anecdotal evidence
suggests that, once people become aware of subconscious bias, they often
catch themselves behaving in such a way.  This is true of women as
well as of men.  Fortunately, once a person is aware of the problem,
the behavior is usually easy to change.  Examples of behaviors to avoid are:
<UL><LI> Assuming, without any information, that women should be given
easier questions or projects than men.
 <LI> Paying more attention to remarks made by men than by women.
 <LI> Assuming, when introduced to a team, that a male is the leader
and primarily addressing comments to him.
 <LI> If a man, being more friendly and encouraging to male peers and
subordinates than to females, even if it is out of a desire to avoid
having one's friendliness mistaken for flirtation.
 <LI> Assuming that a woman will not pursue her career as seriously
as a man because she will leave her job to have children.  While some
women take time off for children, all women (and no men) are hurt by
this prejudice.
</UL>
<P>
Additionally, one can help counteract another person's subconscious
bias by either discreetly calling it to the person's attention or by
directly offsetting it.  For example, if a female colleague keeps
getting interrupted or ignored, one can express interest in what she
is saying without directly telling people to listen to her, which
might be interpreted as patronizing.
<P>

A female graduate student provided me with some positive examples of
how her advisor treated her.  In addition to generally treating her
with respect, by giving her challenging projects and the necessary
resources to complete them, there were two specific things he did that
especially impressed her:
<UL><LI> When the student was preparing a paper the two of them
co-authored for a conference, she
made a dozen copies to send in, as required by the program committee.
When her advisor saw her collating them, he told her that she should
have had the group secretary do that.  The student was impressed with
this remark because she felt other professors might see nothing
wrong with a female's doing clerical work but would have only redirected 
male students to a secretary.
 <LI> When the student proofread a paper for her advisor, he thanked
her by name in the acknowledgments ``for her careful proofreading of this
paper and [acknowledged] her ongoing study of [related research
area]''.  By mentioning her research area, the advisor made clear to
readers that, despite her female name, she was not a secretary.
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION00714200000000000000> Avoiding Unintentionally Offensive or Discriminatory Behavior</A></H3>
<P>
While any well-intentioned person avoids behavior that they know to be
offensive, some people do not realize that certain behaviors,
discussed throughout this report, offend some women.  Good intentions
are no guarantee that women will not get the wrong message.  For
example, a woman might feel uncomfortable with a man who has revealing
pictures of women on his walls or computer screen.  Additionally, by
not using language that could be interpreted as sexist, such as ``he''
for the generic computer architect and terms like ``manpower'', women
feel more included.  One positive example is the name on a sample
application for the United States Department of Defense fellowships,
included in the instruction booklet: ``Smith, Dana Robin.''  Both
``Dana'' and ``Robin'' can be either female or male names.  Another
positive example is the alternating usage of ``he'' and ``she'' as the
default singular program in chapters of the influential <i> Computer
Architecture: A Quantitative Approach</i>, by John Hennessy and David
Patterson.  There are many guides to ``nonsexist'' communication, such
as [<A HREF="node42.html#pernon">Persing 1978</A>].

Someone who supervises a research or work group or organizes its
events should try to choose activities at which all group members
would feel comfortable.  While it is not always possible to choose an
activity that everyone relates to --- for example, some people are
uninterested in any sport --- an effort should be made to include
everyone in at least some of the social occasions.  I have seen people
repeatedly left out of social activities springing from the workplace
because they are poor athletes or disabled, have unusual dietary
requirements, or do not drink alcohol.  Anyone who cannot socialize
with the group will not feel as though they fully belong.
(Conversely, anybody who does not want to socialize with the work
group, for whatever reasons, should not be made to feel unwelcome as a
worker.)

Some professors rarely encourage or praise their students, but such
encouragement, even if just a few spoken words, is greatly appreciated
and rarely forgotten [<A HREF="node42.html#widaaa">Widnall 1988</A>, page 1743,].  For example,
suggesting that a student consider graduate school can make a
substantial difference [<A HREF="node42.html#levnsf">Leveson 1989</A>, page 23,].  In one survey of female scientists, ``[t]he
encouragement of teachers --- along with that of fathers --- was the
influence most frequently quoted as steering [them] towards science''
[<A HREF="node42.html#fertru">Ferry et al 1982</A>, page 27,].  In practice, women often do not get encouragement from teachers and
guidance counselors ([<A HREF="node42.html#swesur">Cooper Union 1989</A>] in [<A HREF="node42.html#baurec">Baum 1990</A>, page
48,]).  While encouragement should be directed to worthy males
and females, it has greatest effect with people who receive little
encouragement and who have low self-esteem, often women [<A HREF="node42.html#zapsta">Zappert et al 1984</A>, page
8,].  (See, for example, page <A HREF="node7.html#mathstory"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> of this report.)
<P>
Additionally, it is important for parents to encourage their daughters
as well as their sons in technical areas.  ``According to one computer
camp director, `Mothers bring their boys to the classes.  Girls have
to beg to enroll''' [<A HREF="node42.html#hesgen">Hess et al 1985</A>, page 201,].  Even if parents do
treat their children equally, it is impossible to make girls feel that
it's as normal for girls to use computers as it is for boys, with all
the biases in our society (Section <A HREF="node6.html#seckid"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>) and in children's
toys and computer games (Section <A HREF="node6.html#sectoy"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>).  Nevertheless, it is
clearly important to encourage one's daughters, and many female
computer scientists attribute their career choice and success to
parents who encouraged them.

Readers will notice that there are many situations for which I made no
recommendations.  For example, I had no advice for the woman who told
me about dining with a group of men after a conference who then began
telling jokes that were specifically degrading of women.  I also have
found myself with nothing to say when a brilliant female graduate
student says she avoids a certain research area because of the
specific men at the university involved in it.  Unfortunately, there
is a substantial class of behavior which is both offensive and
non-actionable.
