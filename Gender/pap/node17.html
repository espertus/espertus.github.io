<P>
Because computer workplaces are often overwhelmingly male, women 
find themselves in what sometimes feels like a locker room
environment, having to put up with behavior they might find offensive,
such as sexist or sexual humor and female pin-ups.  Additionally, some
men use sarcasm or insults to communicate more than women do, causing
women to interpret the environment as hostile, even when no offense is
meant.  Also, because males often have different interests than
females do, such as in sports, women may not feel as though they fit
in.  These factors can cause a woman to feel out of place in a
computer workplace and make it difficult for her to picture herself as
a computer professional.
