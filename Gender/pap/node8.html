In our society, males and females are regarded very differently.
Assertiveness, confidence, and high achievement are considered
consistent with masculinity but not with femininity.  In addition to
the stigma associated with success in general, technical fields are
considered particularly unattractive for females.  These
factors can influence a girl not to pursue an interest in math or
engineering, and they can sabotage a woman's career because either she 
acts feminine, e.g. demure, and is not taken seriously, or she acts
masculine and is met with disapprobation.  Of course, as mentioned in
[<A HREF="node42.html#sidwom">Sidner 1980</A>, page 3,] and [<A HREF="node42.html#horfem">Horner 1970</A>, page 70,], confident females
eventually find male and female friends who like and respect them.
The problem is thus not insurmountable.  Still, it is an additional
barrier that females face, and the playing field will not be level
while these stereotypes exist.
