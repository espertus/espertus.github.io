Having a mentor or sponsor can be of vital importance to a graduate
student or junior professor:
<blockquote> The sponsor may serve many functions for the prot&#233;g&#233;.  First,
the sponsor introduces and initiates the  prot&#233;g&#233; in the
customs, demands, and expectations of academic life.  Second, the
sponsor shares his or her wisdom and knowledge with the
prot&#233;g&#233;, and provides encouragement and comments on his or her
work.  Third, the sponsor can provide career assistance for the
prot&#233;g&#233; by making recommendations to his or her colleagues at
other institutions, or simply by sharing a bit of the deflected glow
from his or her own shining reputation.  Perhaps most important, the
sponsor helps to form with the prot&#233;g&#233; the sense of him or
herself as a member of the profession, encouraging and fostering a
self-image as a legitimate member of the community of scholars
[<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, page 101,].
</blockquote>
Despite the importance of having a mentor, there are few formal
policies to ensure that every graduate student or junior faculty
member receives mentoring.  Although every graduate student, for
example, has a thesis supervisor, the supervisor typically devotes
different amounts of energy to different students.  It is reported
that ``women are more likely than men to be excluded from this sort of
relationship with senior faculty'' [<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, page 102,] [<A HREF="node42.html#halcla">Hall 1982</A>, page
10,].  There are several possible reasons for this exclusion.
First, as discussed above, some men feel uncomfortable dealing with
women as professionals.  Second, some ``faculty men may see women as
being different from themselves, less intellectually able, less
committed and dedicated, or simply inappropriate for academic
careers'' [<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, page 103,].  Third, when men and women work
closely together, there is the risk of their being suspected of having
an affair [<A HREF="node42.html#simaca">Simeone 1987</A>, pages 82--83,].  Additionally, many people
like to help people who are ``like'' them, i.e. of the same sex or
race.  (Indeed, that was a motivation for my writing this report.)  As
long as most of the people in positions of power are men, and as long
as differences in sex are considered to be of great importance, junior
men will benefit.<A NAME=samesex>&#160;</A>
