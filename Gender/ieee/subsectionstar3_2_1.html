     One woman likes the unbalanced percentages between
genders. She is used to working with men and admits the
ratio gives her more visibility, with more positive than
negative repercussions: ``People remember me much more than
if I were a man.'' On the other hand, she noted that some men
claim reverse discrimination, where women have received what
they consider undeserved awards.
<P>
     She also said, ``The women in the department are not
particularly close, partly because there is such a small
selection of us...The chances are small that we will find
other women that we really want to be close with...Also, I
think that most of us women are pretty strong and have
learned how to survive without a support network. That's not
to say it wouldn't be nice to have one, but I don't think
there's a lot of interest - as long as life is not terrible
for women, [we] might as well just get science (or one's
private life) done, instead of meeting about being women in
science.''
<P>
     Another woman commented, ``During my many years of
study, I came in contact with one female professor - first-year music. I had no role models. In fact I was often the
only woman in my class. I was the only female PhD in my
program and for many years the only female faculty member in
my department.''
<P>
     From another: ``I had few female peers and fewer female
professors in graduate school. The ones who `made it' didn't
have the time nor often the inclination to help younger
female precolleagues.''
<P>
     And from a leader: ``I have a selfish motivation in
wanting more women to participate in the field. When a group
wants a woman to give a speech, I am often the one called. I
need to have others share the work load.''
<P>
     Many women raised the issue of tokenism. ``I don't like
being the sole person fighting a battle...There is a
critical mass needed in both race and gender: You need about
one-third representation before you escape from tokenism.
Lower than this, it's hard to keep good female workers.''
