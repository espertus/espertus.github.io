     ``Men have what it takes to run large research groups:
aggressive, dominating attitudes. You have to be
egotistical. You can be egotistical and still act like a
woman.''
<P>
     ``Look at yourself and what you do, and see that it's
great. Convey that in your proposals. `I'm great, and I'm
the only one in the world who can do this.' If you show
doubt, you don't get funded. Look at the large, funded
programs, and what they claimed when they asked for funding.
Yes, this is egotistical, but it's necessary to win
funding.''

     ``As a graduate student, you'll be fighting for space,
fighting with other graduate students. And most of them will
be men. You don't have to be calm and quiet about it.''
<P>
     ``Almost from day one I have been a fairly visible
person in my department. I took some nontrivial courses from
the beginning and audited others (good for getting to know
more faculty and expressing interest). I attend a lot of the
department parties. I go to talks presented by visiting
scientists, even those not in my field. I talk to students
in all areas of research, just to find out what goes on in
the rest of the field. In my second year, I was on the
executive board of our department graduate student
organization, and then became coordinator of the graduate
student talk series. I'd advise any new student to do these
kind of things - not so much for visibility, as for his or her
own intellectual benefit.''
