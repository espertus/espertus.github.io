     When engineers develop new designs, they have to get to
a fairly detailed stage before they can apply CAD tools to
refine and evaluate the model. However, the decisions made
during the early stages of conceptual design are very
important, and have already shaped the process and the
product significantly. Yumi Iwasaki is working on a project
that will help designers make these early decisions. In the
``how things work'' project, she and her colleagues are
working on a prototype that can access an abstract design,
generate a model, and simulate the behavior of the product,
so that designers can get quick feedback as to whether the
design is likely to accomplish an assigned goal. She is also
refining the representation of functions-what needs to be
accomplished and how. If she can make functional
representation more rigorous, she can apply it to evaluate a
design by verifying whether the predicted behavior
accomplishes the function.
<P>
     The big question is deciding how to model the design.
Deciding on an appropriate model depends a lot on what
questions the designer asks. How do we find the relevant
piece of a knowledge base, perhaps just one percent of it?
How do we build just the right model? Part of Iwasaki's work
concerns reasoning about the relevance of knowledge to
formulate the right model. Answers to these questions will
do much to further the field of design.
<P>
     As a shy person and often the only woman, Iwasaki was
uncomfortable in her undergraduate physics classes and ended
up switching to math. In graduate school, she was more
comfortable in her research groups because they were small,
even when she was the only woman. She also got extra
encouragement from her graduate advisor, building her self-
confidence.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Shy students need extra support. With encouragement,
they might produce the same quality of work as an outgoing
student.
     <LI> Smaller groups of students might make the few women
present more comfortable.
