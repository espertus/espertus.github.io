<P>
     Eva Hudlicka is a two-field scientist, working in both
AI and cognitive science. Her overriding interest is in
human information processing and human cognition. Her goal
is to build systems that enhance human use of information
and knowledge.
<P>
     Her AI work deals primarily with model-based reasoning
and its applications to expert systems, training and
tutoring, and information management. She emphasizes one
central idea in this work: By representing the domain of
interest in terms of a model that is consistent with a
person's mental model of that domain, an expert system could
provide better explanation and support training.
<P>
     She was a project manager for a NASA-funded project to
develop an expert, model-based aiding system for commercial
aircraft pilots. One of the outcomes of the project was a
development environment for constructing causal model-based
systems. Now Hudlicka wants to find funding to apply these
techniques to other domains, particularly to biology and
medicine, and eventually to extend the techniques into
multimedia environments.
<P>
     Hudlicka earned her PhD in AI at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. Afterwards, she began shifting
toward cognitive science and computational psychology. She
is now building computational models of human information
processing, focusing on such models as planning, decision
making, and complex, skilled behavior. She is particularly
interested in the memory structures that produce intelligent
behavior and the processes that operate on these structures.
She and her colleagues are looking at the existing ``unified
theories of cognition,'' such as SOAR and Act*, and are
building a testbed that will let researchers experiment with
various models of human information processing.
<P>
     Hudlicka says she never felt discriminated against
because she was female. The University of Massachusetts was
a fairly nonsexist environment, and the presence of ``quite a
number of female grad students'' certainly helped. On the
other hand, the general ``female'' characteristics, such as
lack of confidence in one's own ideas, did affect her. ``I
remember many times talking to people who were so self-
assured about their work and just `knew' they were right - and
early on in my career I was only too ready to assume that
indeed they were and I was wrong. This hurt me during the
selection of my dissertation topic. I think I might have
focused on the type of work I do now much earlier if I had
had more confidence in my intuitions-which turned out to
have been right most of the time!''
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Look for supportive people; when you find someone
who isn't, don't assume it's your problem, go look for
someone else.
<P>
<LI> Trust your ideas and intuitions - and, of course, be
technically good so that the intuitions don't come out of
thin air.
<P>
<LI>  Don't ignore politics. Having your ears open and
being somewhat politically aware is essential to ``getting
ahead.'' I don't mean winning a Nobel prize - I mean simply
being able to get the money to do the research you are
interested in doing.
<P>
<LI> Mentoring programs are great, a good way to ease
difficult transitions.
