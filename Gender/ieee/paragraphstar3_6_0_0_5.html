     The emerging problem of the 1990s, according to Luqi,
is software quality, in addition to the continuing battle of
the 80s to solve productivity problems. Software failures
sometimes have serious consequences, including death,
injury, and financial losses. These problems are often
caused by people failing to understand and communicate
system and resource requirements. Huge amounts of resources
are wasted each year building elaborate systems that do not
solve the right or the entire problem. Luqi is particularly
interested in software automation, since it can improve
software productivity and reliability.
<P>
     Her work in computer-aided prototyping involves
automating development tasks currently carried out by
engineers. She and her Prototyping Research Group are trying
to
<UL><LI> use specifications and abstractions to make
prototypes easier to construct, understand, and analyze,
<LI> use advances in software modeling to produce
tractable formal models of problems, criteria for evaluating
solutions, and solution methods, and
<LI> experimentally construct computer-aided prototyping
systems (CAPS) to demonstrate the feasibility of automation
in software development.
</UL>
Once she and her colleagues have formulated domain
models using software-engineering techniques, they apply AI
technology to automate the solution processes in relatively
narrow areas of tool development.
<P>
     The prototyping approach uses prototype demonstrations
to determine and update the requirements of a proposed
system during both requirements analysis and the
evolutionary life
cycle. Such demos expose misunderstandings and enable
software developers and their clients to converge to an
accurate formulation or a reasonable estimate of the
system's goal. Prototyping tools provide decision support
for formulating a design and establishing system
feasibility; for example, evaluating hard real-time
deadlines for software functions relative to proposed
hardware configurations.
<P>
     This research started a new area of investigation,
combining general software engineering for system modeling
with AI automatic-programming techniques to achieve software
productivity and quality. Luqi initially had trouble
convincing people that the problems had substance and that
solutions were possible until her prototyping systems
started to work. Progress depended on her maintaining
confidence in what made sense in the face of initial
discouraging comments by peers; such criticism actually
motivated her not to quit. To prove that these new ideas
could work, Luqi invested a great deal of effort and long
hours to fill in her students' steep training gaps and to
manage the bureaucratic processes for establishing a lab. A
system that can demonstrate the effectiveness of new ideas
is a very strong argument about the importance and
significance of a scientific contribution.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Set high professional standards (no difference for
men or women) for your job. Focus on the research, and
ignore irritations caused by people with handicapped
personalities.
<LI> Choose research topics with important long-term
effects on society. Though important, theoretical papers are
valuable only if they can be applied to real problems.
<LI> Do not submit to unreasonable pressures. Actions
motivated by gender discrimination will not stand up under
public scrutiny. Most people are professionals, but when you
encounter one that is not, stick to your position and defend
it using rational methods. Professional success is the best
defense.
<LI> Work with the people around you and the people from
professional societies such as the IEEE Computer Society.
Warmth, help, and support can only come from good people.
Seek administration support when needed.
<LI>  Think of the role of the traditional mother: The
lifetime efforts of a large portion of the population are
taken for granted. We are lucky to have the chance to follow
Madam Curie's footsteps.
<LI>  Remember the words of Albert Einstein: ``In the
middle of difficulty lies opportunity,'' and ``Imagination is
more important than knowledge.''
