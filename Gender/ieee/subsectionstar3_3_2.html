     Several people advised going to a graduate school with
a good reputation: ``Don't compromise. You'll meet contacts
that will help you for the rest of your career.''

     One recommended a women's college: ``It's an excellent
environment for academic women. At a small school in a big
university, you get individual attention and mentoring, but
have access to all the resources you need. My school has an
official policy of being sensitive to many needs - those of
women, minorities, the disabled - without being patronizing or
lowering standards. And since it is a women's school, women
have to be trained to take leadership positions.''
