<P>
     Several of the women we interviewed heard of our work
on this article through Systers, a network of 1,100 female
computer scientists, which one woman called ``immeasurably
helpful.'' (For more information, see the accompanying
sidebar on Anita Borg, Systers' originator.)
<P>
     Many people recommended various forms of seminars,
lectures, and lunch meetings for women only; subjects
included how to write a curriculum vitae, how to give a
research talk, how to write a cover letter, the pros and
cons of teaching at four-year colleges, and what it's like
to be a new faculty member. One said, ``The women's group
kept my morale high during the arduous trek through graduate
school.'' And another: ``These group meetings gave me an idea
of who I could talk to about various issues and problems.
They provide a reality check: Is it just me, or is some
other issue involved?''
<P>
     ``Go to conferences for the feeling of community, even
though women are always outnumbered.''
<P>
     ``This [university] atmosphere is very supportive for
everyone. There are so many streams of AI work that no two
people here work on the same thing, so we can afford to help
each other.''
<P>
     ``Travel with another woman and get rooms next to each
other. Plan ahead when you know you'll be arriving at your
destination at odd hours.''
<P>
     ``Take other women's ideas as seriously as men's ideas.''
<P>
     ``Share information about how to get articles written,
reviewed and published; how to find a good job; networking;
how to train your advisor.''
<P>
     A leading researcher attributes part of her success to
collaborating with very good people. She and her colleague
were able to build the costs of travel to work together into
their funding request. If money is tight, she suggests new
means of communication, such as videoconferencing.
