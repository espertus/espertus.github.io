     ``Companies that have multiple locations should be
sensitive to this issue and facilitate internal transfers
for employees in such situations.''

     ``Get your name established before you have children.''

     ``Take turns with your partner on making the hard
choices. It's my husband's turn now - he's quitting a great
job to move with me, and take a leap into the unknown. We've
decided we'd rather compromise our careers than our personal
lives. But right now, we have no idea if this is the right
decision...''

     One mother takes advantage of creative scheduling. She
and her husband each work four days a week; she stays home
on Mondays, and he on Fridays. They use child care three
days a week. Describing her career as on ``the outer
periphery of the inner circle,'' she said, ``I feel like I'm
treading water, but I like my life...We'll keep this
schedule until both kids are in school, about eight to 10
years. This is a rewarding option for both of us, but we
must work efficiently and schedule carefully.'' Asked about
travel, she said each spouse goes to only one or two
conferences a year. Another mother recommends not working
past 5 p.m. or on weekends.

     One interviewee wants to see more programs like
Boston's Parents in a Pinch. Many working parents need
emergency child care now and then but have difficulty
finding it.
