<P>
     Lori Pratt had the advantage of a strong role model at
home: Her mother is a PhD who is very active in the women's
movement and who has always supported her daughter's
interest in science. Pratt has tried academia and industry,
operating systems development, symbolic AI, and neural
networks. She has always been interested in evolution and
biological self-selection-ideas that have led her to study
problem solving, learning, and questions about how new
knowledge can be integrated into existing systems. She's
particularly intrigued by the novel computational properties
that emerge when massively parallel systems are used to
solve problems. Pratt's most active current research
explores the relationship between AI and neural networks - two
fields that she believes have a lot to learn from each
other.
<P>
     Pratt discussed the insights she's gained from AI:
``Knowledge is power, and you learn better on the thresholds
of what you know.'' In her doctoral research, she applied
this idea to neural networks. She studied how a neural
network that's been trained for one task can be mined for
information to be used in a related problem. For instance,
information from a neural network used for speech
recognition in a general population might be used to help
train a new network for a specific speaker. Or a medical
diagnosis neural network built using information about
patients in one geographical location might be used to help
train a network for a different patient population.
<P>
     Pratt's research has also explored more fundamental
questions, such as how to obtain a neural network that uses
a small amount of storage, how to visualize network learning
dynamics, and how to construct large networks modularly.
<P>
     She is just beginning a new job as an assistant
professor in the math and computer science department at the
Colorado School of Mines, where the computer science faculty
women will outnumber the men. And two of the three women are
in AI.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Go to high-quality conferences where you can get
inspired by colleagues' work and the sense of community.
<LI> Husbands and wives should take turns when one is
offered a positive career move.
<LI> Be a good role model: Do good research, and display
this to others.
