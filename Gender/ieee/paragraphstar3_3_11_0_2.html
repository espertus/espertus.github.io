 Institutions need to take
responsible actions to change the persisting percentages.
Here are some suggestions: ``Sometimes, once one or two women
are involved in something, others get involved too. They
feel more comfortable, not so alone (the snowball effect).''
In a similar vein: ``Hire three or four women at a time, to
get beyond the critical mass. Grant additional postdoctoral
slots along with hiring new faculty, so that peers can
support and mentor each other.'' ``Examine organization-sponsored activities for an `old-boy network' style of doing
things, and make an effort to include new blood. Actively
solicit from a wider spectrum of candidates.'' ``Make sure
qualified women get the scholarships and research posts that
tend to keep students in the program longer and eventually
do PhDs.''
<P>
     One professor talked about the importance and
difficulty of hiring and keeping women and minorities. ``The
dean challenged his department units: If any of them hired
one woman or minority, he would use his discretionary funds
to pay the salary of a second woman or minority hired into
the same unit. His rationale is that, since keeping them
seems to be very difficult in a white-male-dominated
culture, it is important not just to add tokens, but to add
real critical mass and create the culture that's necessary
for women and minorities to flourish.''
<P>
     And finally, one woman offered a perhaps obvious but
especially important piece of advice: ``Small gestures toward
inclusion mean a lot. Make women feel welcome. But this is
not just about women: Any underrepresented group needs to
feel like they are first-class members of the community.''
<P>
     Some women we spoke to had never experienced overt
sexism. Perhaps the ``old-boy network'' is more historical
than real, as one woman put it. Another reported that women
are being promoted faster than men at her site. No doubt
some problems are due to individual rather than to societal
quirks and inadequacies. In any case, individuals and groups
are making changes. Some organizations and committees go out
of their way now to look for balance.
<P>
     The underrepresentation problem does not derive from
the fact that female scientists are consciously ignored, but
that
<OL><LI> unconscious biases drive some women to quit
science, and
<LI> not enough women (and minorities) are entering
scientific fields in the first place.
</OL>
<P>
     One woman believes strongly that we must ``improve
primary and secondary education, especially in mathematics,
the basis of all science. Today's children don't know math
or the fun of it.''
<P>
     Since AI is a relatively young science, and the number
of women is small to start with, there are not enough women
at the necessary career levels to reach ``critical mass.''
Several women talked about being deluged with requests to
speak at meetings or sit on committees; since it is
``politically correct'' these days to appear unbiased, those
women who are qualified and have established names are asked
to do much more than they have time for.
<P>
     The interviewees emphasized the need to encourage
people, and especially women and minorities, to pursue AI
and other scientific careers, and then to find ways to keep
these people involved.
<P>
     Of course, there were many positive comments, too,
especially how much these women are enjoying their research
endeavors. Not surprisingly, the most common suggestion we
heard was to do high-quality science. Women are clearly
doing their part, for themselves and for the field.
