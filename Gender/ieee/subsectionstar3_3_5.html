<P>
     Start up new databases of potential candidates where
there are none. Use and support the databases that are
growing. For example, the Computing Research Association's
Committee on the Status of Women is compiling a database of
female computer scientists in the US and Canada.<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap123.xbm"> Joan
Feigenbaum, a researcher at AT&TBell Laboratories, has
finished the first round of data collection and is now
constructing the database with information on 500 PhDs and
women enrolled in PhD programs. The database will be updated
regularly. The committee would like to increase coverage but
needs more resources from other groups.
<P>
     ``Nominate women for awards. Invite or request that
specific women be invited to give talks at your school or
workplace.''
<P>
     ``I made a deal on women hires... I agreed to pay the
salary of one woman out of my grant money if the dean hired
two women (and of course one had to be in AI or it wouldn't
work to pay her from my contract). As a result of my
challenge, we made offers to two women. One is coming. The
AI person turned us down because of a two-body problem.''
<P>
     ``Don't get romantically involved with a professor, on
or off your committee. People will say you graduated only
because of his influence.''
<P>
     ``Try not to let the nonsense get you down-people say and do a
lot of stupid sexist things, and most of them will have zero impact on
anything except possibly your self-confidence. Don't let them have
even that impact.''
