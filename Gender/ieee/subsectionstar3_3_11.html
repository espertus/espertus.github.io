     A number of people suggested more flexible work
environments. One woman said, ``Employers should acknowledge
the demands that come from combining career and family
goals...For example, a woman should be able to choose to
work less than full-time without sacrificing all employee
benefits. It is often difficult for women to find
appropriate positions that will let them work less than
full-time under any conditions. If women are kept out of the
work force by inappropriate conventions, everyone loses.''
Another woman chided, ``Don't punish men who decide to spend
time with their families.''

     Most people would like institutions to foster new and
existing mentoring programs. Several schools, such as the
Stevens Institute of Technology<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap129.xbm"> and the University of Texas
at Austin,<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap131.xbm"> have been taking the lead, along with the
Association for Women in Science.<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap133.xbm">  Hosting female-only
meetings and seminars was a common suggestion (although one
woman objected to these groups as sexist). Another
participant suggested, ``Encourage study groups. Successful
people in science work in groups. We experimented with this,
introducing students to each other for group work, and they
continued (meeting voluntarily). It was very useful and did
not cost a lot of money. We also schedule mentoring labs
after class.''

     In terms of family life, many want increased child care
spaces for the staff's children, and more baby-sitting
services offered at conferences.
