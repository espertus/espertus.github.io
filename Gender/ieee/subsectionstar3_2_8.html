     As far as promotions go, several women attested to the
glass ceiling: ``I don't think it's due to any malevolence on
the part of management, but simply because most of
management is male and feels more comfortable dealing with
other men.''
<P>
     A senior researcher believes that a woman's gender-related experiences depend a lot on her generation. ``The
greatest change has come at the bottom of the pyramid;
junior faculty members have so far not encountered obvious
obstacles. It's different at the top.'' While she sees
herself in the vanguard, the only woman in many situations,
she does not consider herself part of the ``in'' group. She
believes women can go further in industry than in academia.
Evaluations are more structured and above-board, and depend
on more objective criteria.
<P>
     Others also mentioned the pyramid effect: ``I'm almost
uniformly the only woman on a program committee, the only
woman among a list of invited speakers. Men make up the
reviewing committees, and they choose mostly men. There are
women in the audience, but not where I am; there is no one
ahead of me to fight for me.''
