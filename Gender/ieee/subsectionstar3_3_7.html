<P>
     Having a mentor certainly isn't a new idea, but it is
an important factor. A few people mentioned the value of
male versus female mentors. One person said, ``You have to
have a male mentor - mostly because there aren't many female
ones around to wait for. I was lucky to have had two
excellent male mentors. They made sure I survived, and they
shared their network with me.''
<P>
     A number of professors said they want their own mentor,
not necessarily female, who understands the biases that
exist and could help them find creative ways to deal with
situations.

     A few women pointed to their parents or their mothers
as having mentored them: ``My parents were both medical-school professors. I had role models to follow.''
