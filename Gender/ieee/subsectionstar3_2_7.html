     Several people talked about the issue of power rather
than gender, of being in the ``in'' group. One person
described the ``self-selecting good-old-boy network'' based in
well-known, large universities. People with ``new'' ideas,
like fuzzy processing or neural networks, could not break
in, so they left mainstream AI and started their own
``clubs.'' Several people emphasized that problems with
uncooperative or unsupportive advisors can happen to anyone;
the difference is that women with lower self-confidence
sometimes fault themselves for such problems, and leave
programs rather than fight for a new advisor.
<P>
     Several people talked about personality issues, not
necessarily tied to gender. In their early years of
education, women are often encouraged to be quiet and not
respond to criticism, cultivating bad habits for a
successful science career where researchers must sometimes
get into the intellectual fray. Quiet, retiring men have
similar problems. One woman suggested picking a school that
fits one's personality; some schools have a reputation of
being more nurturing than others.
<P>
     One woman feels especially isolated: ``It has not been
easy as a faculty member here - it makes the situations in
undergraduate and graduate school seem trivial. I do not
have a mentor in the field or in this department. This makes
it incredibly difficult to publish or get funding. It is
difficult to get the respect of one's peers because they
assume you were hired on the `woman track' and therefore are
not quite in their league. It is difficult to get the
respect of the graduate students for very similar reasons:
If they perceive that the other faculty have no regard for
you, they see no reason why they should either. For
instance, I was abused by an ex-student of mine who tried to
publish my paper under his name, and the department and the
university offered no help... I am considering a job in
industry. If I leave academia, it will be with a great sense
of personal failure. The fact that I have survived thus far
is mostly due to my `never-say-die' attitude fostered by my
super-supportive parents as well as my super-supportive
husband.''
<P>
     Another said, ``The attrition rate of female faculty
here is nearly 100 percent. The environment is survival of
the fittest: You have to compete to get an advisor, compete
to get an account on a machine. If the university creates an
environment in which people must struggle and claw to get
basic resources to do their work, it ends up selecting a
population for those skills and not necessarily for academic
ability. And on average, this process takes a higher toll on
women. This wastes a lot of human resources.''
<P>
     ``We women have been taught to put ourselves down,''
another interviewee said. ``We're more objective in
describing our projects and results, and not willing to play
the hype game. Over time, history will give women credit for
not hyping their work. The problem is, we're competing with
`hypers,' and at any given time a good sales job can
determine who gets funding. Of course, most men aren't
willing to hype their results, either. Hypers represent a
small piece of the AI community.''
<P>
     An ex-AI person also addressed the question of hype: ``I
was involved in AI three different times. Each time I had to
deal with people who felt they had to oversell what they
were doing to get funding. Often they were young, eager men
with little sense of perspective, and no experience in
marketing. At the first site, a company, we began with six
female managers out of 20. The women seemed to be more
reasonable, with more sense of balance. It's a question of
research versus production: You can promise you'll do
research, but you can't promise you'll produce. By the end
of one year, all six had left [and] another woman had been
hired.''
<P>
     Two women talked about peer competitiveness: ``My
biggest gripe is that my fellow female students, rather than
being timid and unassuming, were fiercely competitive. Most
of the science students I knew were unwilling to have any
kind of intellectual conversation about anything for fear of
sharing information. The close friends I made were those who
could get past this barrier. We studied
together and shared insights - these were my most fulfilling
times at school.''
<P>
     Regarding access to granting agencies, one woman said,
``The senior people were reluctant to let us junior
researchers have any contact with the funding people who
came to our site. Everyone was out for themselves.''
