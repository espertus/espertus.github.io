<H4><A NAME=SECTION00060012000000000000> Anita Borg and the Systers network<BR></A></H4>
<P>
     For Anita Borg, a consultant engineer at Digital
Equipment Corporation's Western Research Lab, the Systers
network combines 23 years of computer work with 25 years of
feminism. Systers started almost five years ago, when about
25 women got together for dinner at an operating-systems
conference and decided to stay in touch. It now has 1,100
members in 15 countries representing more than 150 colleges
and universities and 75 companies. There are also a few
subject-related sublists, including one for AI. Despite its
size, Systers continues to work well, according to Borg,
because of the social mechanisms in place and the ``serious,
concerned, and sophisticated people'' who use it. She is
working on automating some of the administrative tasks
involved; for instance, users will eventually be able to
remove themselves from the list during vacations and then
reinstate themselves.
<P>
     Since all messages go to all members, the social
culture of the network had to evolve as Systers grew. When
there were about 200 members, the network was getting
unwieldy with too many messages and too much conversation.
Borg developed a number of rules; for instance, when someone
sends a question to the entire list, individuals respond
directly to the asker, who compiles the responses and
broadcasts a summary back to the list. Borg sets the tone,
encouraging members to think hard about what they send to
the list. The network is not moderated, but Borg corrects
things if they go off track. Almost no arguments have
occurred. She believes that the network's existence proves
that electronic mail can be used ethically. ``There is
something quite incredible about the way women interact and
the seriousness with which they take this resource.''
<P>
     ``An essential element [of the network's success] is
that it has created a global community of women who would
otherwise have very little opportunity to interact with
others like themselves. Systers provides both role models
and mentoring; it is a sounding board when one feels alone,
isolated, that she might be the only person in the world who
ever experienced something. Finding that you are not alone
is empowering and encouraging.
<P>
     ``As a geographically dispersed and often individually
isolated minority in computer science, women rarely have the
opportunity to interact in person with other women on any
subject in the field. Systers exposes women to the full
range of significant professional interactions among women
without the perception of help by or input from men. This
serves to bolster self-esteem and independence.
<P>
     ``Systers has helped us realize that computer science is
not a men's club in which we each in isolation are the
freakish exception. There are many of us. We have much in
common. And we have much to offer and to gain by staying in
the field.''
<P>
     Borg certainly enjoys her work, and appreciates the
freedom DEC gives her to pursue research of her own choice.
Her latest project supersedes her previous interests in
operating-system and performance analysis. She is working on
creating a database of Systers users, who would each control
the contents of her entry and the accessibility of each
field. Users could direct e-mail through the database to
dynamic subsets within the list. The public part of the
database could also help people identify qualified female
candidates for appointments. This project has implications
far beyond Systers for enriched communication among groups
with common interests.
<P>
