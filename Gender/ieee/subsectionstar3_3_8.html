     ``Work with all your advisees, not just an inner circle.
A star might be lurking quietly in the background.''
<P>
     ``Teach those you mentor about politics and business, as
well as AI.''
<P>
     ``To be a good role model, be the best woman you can. Be
a good researcher, and display this to others. Under the
current momentum, historical underrepresentation will
persist.''
<P>
     ``We need more women who are visible at the top.''
<P>
     ``My advisor supports a self-directed advising style. He
prefers a `hands-off' approach. This teaches independence,
which you'll need later.''
<P>
     ``Encourage women to develop and build independent
computer systems. Having to demonstrate one's system
repeatedly gives a student good exposure and visibility.''
<P>
     A graduate student recommended that faculty members
help or talk about things with women students: ``It is really
good to be working for my [advisor]. She is very outspoken
about women's issues and likes mentoring and encouraging
women.''
<P>
     Having talked about organizing graduate women's support
groups, one professor discussed the need to support and
encourage female undergraduates. She suggested having more
luncheons and other meetings directed toward them.
