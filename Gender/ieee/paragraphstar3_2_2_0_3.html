 Two women mentioned problems at work with
``wallpaper'' backgrounds in graphical user interfaces: ``My
colleagues just don't get it - why I'm uncomfortable with
seminude Windows displays.'' In a similar vein, another said,
``I'm fed up with the alias `gradstuds' on the network, and
nongender-neutral language. This kind of politics saps my
energy away from my research.''

     One professor described a contentious work environment.
When she disagreed with some of her male colleagues, they
told her she doesn't know how to be a wife or a professor.
She believes they would never talk to her like that if she
were male, or shout at her as they have. Taking any
disagreement with a woman very personally, they get angry
easily.
