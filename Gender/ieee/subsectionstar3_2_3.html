     Interviewees often raised dual-career issues, often
called ``two-body problems,'' which are no different for
people in AI than in any other field. ``When I was in grad
school, my husband was a postdoctoral fellow at another
university, so we met on weekends. When we got jobs in the
Northeast, we were still 180 miles apart. Finally, after
three years of separation, I got a job near him and will be
moving there. All dual-career couples have to face this
problem.''
<P>
     Another feels both insecure in her job and ``stuck,''
since her husband has tenure: ``If I were not happy, I
couldn't do anything about it.'' They have both compromised
their careers and personal lives: After living apart for
years, they left good jobs and had to build new careers.
<P>
     A leader in the field said she has benefitted from the
fact that her husband is also in AI. He not only understands
what she is doing but supports her efforts and values her
achievements. Many women don't have the male support she
does.
