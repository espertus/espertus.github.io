<P>
     Because Beverly Woolf's research interests span several
fields, the students she attracts come from varied
backgrounds, including computer science, education, and the
physical sciences. Together, they are designing knowledge-
based tutoring systems for subjects ranging from high school
physics to emergency cardiac treatment.
<P>
     About 100 paper mills now use Woolf's tutoring system
for recovery boilers. Operators used to have many accidents;
Woolf's system was so successful at showing operators how to
avoid accidents that insurance companies now require mills
to use it in the control room. And the system did not cost a
lot of money to develop. Woolf sees a great need in
industrial and technical societies for one-on-one training
and alternative teaching systems. She would like teachers to
have a repertoire of tools at their disposal, including
tutoring systems.
<P>
     A key to building these systems, Woolf says, is
involving educators who know their discipline. These domain
experts are invaluable during design and testing, because
they quickly find gaps in the software. Woolf used a high-school physics teacher over a long period of time to test
and refine the physics tutor. Now she and her colleagues are
testing their cardiac-arrest tutoring system. Recently, they
found that doctors using the program quickly forgot it was a
simulation and began acting as if they were handling a real
emergency. She expects this system to be ready in about a
year.
<P>
     Now Woolf is ready to take the field to the next level:
to create shells that can get more systems produced and
installed, helping to teach in multiple domains. One of the
exciting things about knowledge-based tutoring systems is
that it is ``AI-complete'' - that is, almost all the subareas of
the field, even machine learning, will be involved as
applications are developed.
<P>
     As a woman and a leader in the field of knowledge-based
tutoring systems, Woolf finds she is often the only woman on
a program committee, the only woman on a list of invited
speakers. She's looking forward to the day when she won't be
the only one.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Collate and make available lists of qualified female
candidates, so that colleagues can use them to recruit
speakers and committee members.
<LI> Encourage group sharing and support: Successful
people in science work in groups.
<LI> Believe in your own work, don't manifest doubt.
<LI> Break stereotypes: Women don't have to be placid and
nourishing.
<LI> Cultivate a strong personality: Good science is
often supported by a powerful and committed personality.
<LI> Get a male mentor: If your environment has few
female teachers, find a man who can be helpful.
<LI> On the other hand, research shows that female
graduate students do better if they work with a female
researcher.
