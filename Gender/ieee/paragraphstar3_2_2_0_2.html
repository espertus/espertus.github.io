 One interviewee's experiences seem to
correlate with the <i>IEEE Expert</i> author who was worried about
her byline: ``I've had two papers rejected - I used my first
name in both. I've had three accepted, and I used only my
initials in those. So now I submit papers with initials
only; it doesn't hurt, just in case.''

     Gender-biased language annoys several of the people we
spoke to. While it may seem trivial to some, these women
said it distracts them from their work. One said, ``In the AI
linguistics class, we found sexism in all the example
sentences. For example, the active person was always male:
`John kicked the ball.' Women sometimes appeared in the
passive role: `Bill threw the book at Jane.' The one
exception was `Mary mended the sock.' Many of the women in
the department were incensed at this, because it is
blatantly sexist, totally unnecessary, and easily avoided.
If AI is to attract and keep women's respect and interest,
this sort of thing should be tackled first.''
