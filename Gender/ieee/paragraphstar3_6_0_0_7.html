     Jill Crisman is researching biologically based robotic
systems as well as computer vision techniques for
intelligent robotics. She is working with a biologist to
understand how a lobster's central nervous system controls
walking, and then implementing this control strategy in an
ambulatory robot. They have simulated the central pattern
generator, and the command and coordination systems that
generate muscle control signals for stable walking gaits.
<P>
     A second project, building a user interface to a robot
wheelchair, involves computer vision and intelligent
control. The user would point to a location on a video
screen and issue a command such as ``go there'' or ``track
that.'' The robot would then go to the location or follow the
target while avoiding obstacles along the way. Crisman plans
to extend this interface to control manipulation tasks as
well.
<P>
     Crisman's doctoral research at Carnegie Mellon
University dealt with a computer vision system that could
detect roads for a robot van. Her system could track
difficult roads that had potholes and degraded road edges
but no lane markings. CMU's Navlab robot (see <i>IEEE Expert</i>,
Aug. 1991, pp. 31-52) successfully drove on many of these
roads in a variety of weather conditions using Crisman's
computer vision system.

     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Find a mentor. Older and more experienced mentors
can often explain the ``rules'' of your discipline and
specialty. A female mentor can provide first-hand advice,
although a male mentor might still be able to provide much
of the same advice from a different perspective.
<LI> Find female friends. They can offer great moral
support, since they might have encountered many of the same
issues.
