<P>
     Subramanian is interested in both theoretical computer
science and AI; having begun her graduate work in parallel
program correctness and design, she found the questions of
AI more intellectually appealing. She became tantalized, in
her words, by ``the long-term scientific goal of
understanding intelligence through computation and the
shorter term goal of making machines smarter than they are
today.''
<P>
     In her doctoral research, Subramanian noted that
today's systems, intelligent or otherwise, are limited by
the conceptualization of the world given to them by their
designers. When computational constraints on a task change,
people have to reprogram the system. She constructed a
theory of how an intelligent system faced with new
computational pressures from the environment can
automatically abstract its knowledge to solve its goals
faster. This saves human designers from the tedium of
reprogramming and allows systems to adapt to their
environment by reprogramming themselves.
<P>
     With one of her students, she has applied this theory
to the task of optimizing functional programs. They have
shown that the suite of optimizations discovered by people
over the last 20 years can be automatically discovered by a
machine in a few days.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Speak up for what you want, despite others'
stereotypical attitudes.
<LI> Join ``women in computer science'' groups for peer  support.
<LI> Working independently in graduate school will serve
you well in your career.
