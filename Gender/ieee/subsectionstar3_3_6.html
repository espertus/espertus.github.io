     ``If you have a disagreement with someone, and his anger
gets out of control, discuss the issues in private. Always
bring another person in the room with you. Tell him calmly
that his behavior is unprofessional. If he is still yelling,
leave the room. Women must have professional standards of
behavior; for instance, they need not allow anyone to yell
at them. Always evaluate the professional role you're in at
the moment, and what the best course of action is for that
role, rather than how a woman would react.''
