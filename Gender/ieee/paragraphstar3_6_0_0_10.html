     While the title of Ritu Chadha's doctoral dissertation
is daunting - Applications of Unskolemization - the
ramifications of that research are far reaching.
Unskolemization is the process of replacing certain
functions by existentially quantified variables in logic
formulas, which is useful for deducing facts about
collections of logical formulas. As a doctoral student at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she
developed an algorithm for performing unskolemization and
applied it to several areas, including the automation of
program verification.
<P>
    ``The foremost problem in software development today is
ensuring the correctness of software,'' according to Chadha.
Much research has been devoted to mechanizing the
verification process, but no one had been able to devise a
general method for mechanically deriving program loop
invariants - until Chadha developed an algorithm based on her
thesis work. This opens up the possibility of building
systems that will mechanically prove the correctness of
software. ``There is still a lot of work to be done to make
such systems commercially viable,'' she said, but this could
dramatically cut the cost of software development since
laboratories typically budget as much as 50 percent of their
cost for software testing.
<P>
     She also applied her thesis to machine learning,
developing another algorithm based on unskolemization that
deduces certain facts about collections of objects or
statements. For example, given examples of a class of
objects, the algorithm can generate a general description of
objects in that class. This method can be applied in program
verification as well as other fields.
<P>
     Chadha spent most of her adolescent years in a highly
respected high school for girls in India. The teachers (all
female) warned the students that science and math were not
``for girls.'' While she believes this discouraged many
talented girls, she persisted, going on to major in
mathematics at Delhi University and earn the highest grades
ever obtained there in any subject. During her undergraduate
and graduate school years, Chadha never encountered any
discrimination due to gender. However, the disproportionate
male-female ratio in computer science departments did make
it difficult for her to interact socially with students.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Don't lose confidence in yourself despite any
discouragement or discrimination you may encounter.
<LI> Never think in terms of gender where work and
ability are concerned.
<LI> Don't be afraid to point out any discrimination if
and when you encounter it.
<LI> Companies with multiple locations should be
sensitive to the ``two-body problem'' (where both members of a
couple need to work) and facilitate internal transfers for
employees in such situations.
