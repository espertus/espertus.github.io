     Many of those we talked to pointed to volunteering in
various ways to get oneself known: Call a technical-committee member,
send your resume to a book reviews editor, 
volunteer to give conference talks for your colleagues,
write conference papers and book chapters, run workshops, or
organize new workshops. One woman said, ``Write papers for
workshops. They're small, you'll meet people in your field,
names become faces, you'll feel a part of a community.
National conferences can be enormous and intimidating. Also,
workshops are meant for preliminary work. They are a good
forum for graduate students. Getting a paper accepted is
real validation - it can be a big boost when you need one.
Rewards in research can be few and far between.''

     ``It's best if you're the sole author. Second best is to
be the first author in a group-authored paper.''
<P>
     ``Write a textbook; if possible, one of the first in an
area. In fact, just write a lot. This is especially good for
shy people.''
<P>
     Another added, ``It's better to have something
worthwhile (a finished project of some sort, such as a good
dissertation) to support your claims to fame.''
