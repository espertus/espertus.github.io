     Women at various career levels mentioned invisibility:
``I'd say something in my group, and no one heard me. When
the person next to me repeated my idea, everyone
complimented him. This happened several times. Maybe it's
female tentativeness, looking for agreement before standing
up for what you believe. After a few times, I said to the
person repeating my idea, `Yes, that's exactly what I was
trying to say earlier. Thank you for rephrasing my idea.'
The group slowly got what was happening, and it has
stopped.''

     A well-known woman said, ``When I interact with
industry, I am often ignored in favor of my male colleagues,
even when I am the senior scientist and principal
investigator. One experience remains in my mind, a visit
from a granting committee: A colleague and I, as
coinvestigators, were up for a grant renewal. We had invited
a junior member of the department to participate in the new
grant. While the funding agents, all men, spent three to
four hours questioning us, they did not address one question
to me. Instead they asked my coinvestigator and the junior
man, who had not even participated in the previous grant.''

     Finally, another leader in AI said, ``Companies are
worse than universities. A company is much more structured;
you have to `fit in.' They tolerate me because I bring in
money and do my work. I'm never given credit or asked my
opinion. I feel personal invisibility here...it's an
emotional drain. I never felt that in academia. Other
companies have significant equal-opportunity efforts. You
won't find token minorities there.''
