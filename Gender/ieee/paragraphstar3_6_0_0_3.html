<P>
     As one of the coinventors of case-based reasoning (and
a recently elected AAAI fellow), Janet Kolodner is applying
her research in several real domains. Most importantly, she
wants to make case-based reasoning do something; that is,
make it work in real situations.
<P>
     First, she is asking what it means for computers or
people to be creative. She and her students have worked on a
program that plans meals for people with dietary
restrictions. Such software must remember cases, suggest
nutritious but not boring meals, be aware of correct
textures and how real food should taste, and come up with
various possibilities. The program was able to come up with
breakfasts that matched what human dieticians were doing,
but the meals were not very creative. In another program,
Kolodner and her group added brainstorming and evaluative
components and got far more creative solutions. They are now
looking at creative problem solving across several different
design domains: lesson plan creation, meal planning,
software design, and architecture.
<P>
     Kolodner is also using what she's learned about case-
based problem solving to build interactive systems that can
help people solve problems. The systems provide three major
services:
<OL><LI> They help people identify what they should be
paying attention to as they solve problems.
<P>
<LI> They point out the challenges that people are
likely to encounter when they try to carry out solutions in
the world.
<P>
<LI> They suggest solutions to problems posed by the
user.
</OL>
<P>
     They do this by presenting cases (collected from
experts) that teach an appropriate lesson and that the user
has probably never seen before. The systems augment the
memories of people, allowing them to do case-based reasoning
even though they themselves don't have a store of their own
cases.
<P>
     One part of this project aims at helping elementary-
school teachers teach science. Kolodner's group is
collecting the experiences and lesson plans of experienced
and novice teachers. With help from the novices, they are
identifying the sorts of problems teachers need help with;
from experienced teachers, they are collecting solutions to
those problems. This information is then made available to
the teachers who need it. She is also looking at the use of
this technology in design, and in particular, architecture.
<P>
     As a senior woman in her field and on her campus,
Kolodner is asked to take on a lot of extra
responsibilities. There are more senior men to share similar
requests, so each one's burden is less. Kolodner said it
will greatly help the current batch of female scientists to
have more women around.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> If you're not sure of yourself, pretend! Act self-confident.
<LI> Go to conferences, get on panels; create your own
new forum, start a new journal.
<LI> More than just a few people need to suggest names
for speakers, panels, and committees, so that a broad range
of candidates are considered.
<LI> Grit your teeth and go after funding. To open doors,
invoke the name of someone known in your field.
<LI> If you are one of those known researchers, tell your
junior colleagues to use your name to help them get funding.
</OL>
