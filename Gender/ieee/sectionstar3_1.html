<P>
     We started by looking at at the representation of women
in AI publications and conferences. While these statistics
do not necessarily indicate what proportion of AI scientists
overall are women, they do provide a context for examining
how women are faring generally in AI. Women represented
<UL><LI> 10 percent of the program committee members at 25
AI-related conferences over the last three years;
 <LI> 8 percent of the invited speakers at seven AI-related conferences;
 <LI> 9 percent of the principal presenters at AAAI '91
and '92, and 11 percent at the Canadian AI '92 conference;
 <LI> 9 percent of the editorial-board members of 17 AI
journals and magazines.
 <LI> 9 percent of the authors in <i>IEEE Expert</i>, <i>Artificial
Intelligence</i>, and <i>AI Magazine</i> combined over the last four
years;
 <LI> an average of 9 percent of the authors in five other
domain-specific journals and transactions, ranging from 4
percent (in pattern analysis and machine intelligence) to 37
percent (in user modeling);
 <LI>  about 25 percent of AAAI's executive councillors;
and
 <LI> about 8 percent of AAAI fellows.
</UL>
<P>
     The representation of women in academic institutions
varies tremendously, and the numbers mean different things
at different institutions (0 out of 4 isn't the same as 0
out of 40). Many computer science departments have no female
professors, while one has more women than men. It was
impossible to count the percentage of women among AI
graduate students, since schools handle these numbers
differently. However, a few reported that around 10-15
percent of their computer science graduate students are
women, and that the number of female applicants has
decreased in the last two years.
<P>
     The women we interviewed pointed to a particular aspect
of AI that might have reduced the number of women in the
field. A necessary part of early AI research was Lisp.
Working with Lisp required Lisp machines, which were only
found at the first and few schools involved in AI, expensive
schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Stanford University, and Carnegie Mellon University. A small
group of men at these institutions were thus the first
members of AI's ``inner circle.'' AI has recently been applied
to other, less expensive platforms, and the inner circle's
proteges (and their students) have begun to spread out to
other private and public schools across the country. Yet
many still feel on the outside of the circle.
<P>
     One senior interviewee characterized these early years
of AI as ``far out'' and its adherents, struggling to earn
credibility, as arrogant. ``It was like a frontier
atmosphere: it drew people who could compete and go out on a
limb without being right. This usually isn't women. The
women who `made' it were the ones who had
advisors in the original inner circle. Besides, early on,
more women than men were horrified by the idea of building a
machine as intelligent as people.''
<P>
     But as AI has since developed, some women now see it as
a ``natural'' place for their research: ``AI has more cognitive
aspects than does computer science. Since women are
generally more introspective, attuned to psychology, and
more verbal than men, AI has a natural draw.'' Another woman
who believes there are more women in AI than in computer
science said it's because AI is a newer field ``with less
baggage,'' so it offers good careers with fewer stereotypes.
Other women noted the ``scruffiness'' of AI and its
connections to ``softer'' sciences like education and
psychology. On the other hand, the stereotypes often break
down: One woman noted that her female natural-language
colleagues come from heavy math and linguistics backgrounds.
