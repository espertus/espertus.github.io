     Mental imagery has been an active area of research in
cognitive psychology for a number of years, but Janice
Glasgow is one of the first people to consider imagery as a
reasoning paradigm in artificial intelligence. Computational
imagery involves the ability to generate, transform, and
inspect visual and spatial representations of images to
retrieve and reason with information not explicitly stored
in long-term memory. For example, a spatial image of a chess
board could be reconstructed and then analyzed to determine
if a particular motif is a subimage in it.
<P>
     Glasgow is developing a knowledge representation scheme
for imagery. This scheme represents knowledge in terms of a
semantic network in long-term memory, organized according to
the structural and conceptual hierarchies of the image
domain. She has two working-memory representations for
visual and spatial reasoning, corresponding to distinct
components in human cognition. This research evolved out of
her earlier work on programming languages for AI. She was
involved in the development of Nial, a high-level
programming language based on the mathematics of array
theory. The mathematical basis of this language now provides
a metalanguage for specifying the representations and
primitive functions for computational imagery.
<P>
     One of the most exciting aspects of this work is an
application she and her colleagues are developing with an
international team of crystallographers: a knowledge-based
approach for molecular reconstruction. The long-term memory
model for molecular images is being constructed using
crystallographic databases containing over 100,000
previously determined scenes. The researchers are
integrating the tools and techniques of computational
imagery with aspects of earlier work on Crysalis, recent
theoretical advances in protein crystallography and AI, and
a more case-based approach to reasoning. This is an
ambitious project, with the potential to greatly assist in
the determination of protein structures. Currently, a lab
may take several years to determine a single structure.
Glasgow's group hopes to have a prototype knowledge-based
assistant system within a year or two.
<P>
     Glasgow also believes that imagery is an important
alternative reasoning paradigm. According to her recent
studies in machine learning and database discovery, this
knowledge representation scheme may provide powerful tools
for classification based on spatial reasoning.
<P>
     Glasgow was the program cochair of AI '92 and is now
president of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies
of Intelligence, one of the oldest national AI societies in
the world. She is also a principal investigator in the
Intelligent Robotics and Intelligent Systems Federal Center
of Excellence and the principal researcher on an AI project
for the Canadian Space Agency.
<P>
     Regarding career development for women, she said, ``I
think things have improved in the last 20 years. There is a
greater awareness among both men and women...Only in the
last few years have I been able to find female scientists at
similar career points to me. It has been very supportive to
talk to them and share experiences.'' Glasgow believes more
women need to hold positions that make a difference-on
granting committees, program committees, as senior
administrators in academia and industry, on boards of
directors.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Younger women should seek out peers as well as role
models. They can be especially supportive.
<P>
<LI> Take a leading role: Present a paper if you are a
coauthor, organize conferences and workshops, act as
principal investigator on grants and contracts, get involved
in activities that bring you to the forefront. This means
you have to sometimes get aggressive, which is difficult for
most of us.
<P>
<LI> Women on program committees need to nominate other
women as invited speakers. There are a lot of supportive men
who are also willing to help promote women, but sometimes
just need a bit of awareness. I have had mainly positive
experiences on committees when I suggest bringing more
visibility to deserving women.
<P>
<LI> Women need to educate one another on how to react
when obstacles arise. The Systers network has helped a lot.
