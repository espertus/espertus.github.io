<P>
     Are women more interested in conflict resolution than
men? Whether or not this is true, Susan Lander is looking at
this area from an interesting point of view - one might even
say from a woman's perspective.
<P>
     In her work with multiagent systems, Lander
investigates different methods for resolving conflicts,
especially those in which agents don't act with hostility.
Rather than competing for resources, these agents interact
cooperatively. Either all agents win, or they gradually and
equitably relax their requirements until they come to an
agreement. She has developed systems in two domains: the
design of steam condensers, and buy-sell contract
negotiation. As an example, an agent negotiating a buy-sell
contract in Lander's cooperative system will look for the
fairest price, not just the best price from its selfish
perspective.
<P>
     Lander's evolution to become a scientist is unique. She
came to the university as a secretary in the Computer
Science Department, but knew she wanted to do more. She has
been at the university for 14 years in various capacities:
first as a secretary and then as a student, earning her BS,
MS, and soon to receive her PhD there - along with adopting
two children.
<P>
     Suggestions:
<OL><LI> Be aware of your priorities. ``Having it all'' is only
realistic if you accept that you can't be the ``perfect''
mother, wife, student, and researcher all at the same time.
Find the balance that works for you.
<LI> Universities should extend tenure decisions to give
women with families a more reasonable amount of time to
produce valuable work.
