     Candy Sidner, a AAAI fellow and a member of the
research staff at Digital's Cambridge Research Laboratory,
talked on the record about the differences between working
in a place with few female peers and a place where women
comprise a sizable proportion, a ``critical mass.'' Her lab
has six women among 22 principal researchers, enough to
change the environment, including how people interact and
treat each other. She explained, ``I think men have a hard
time collaborating with women (in either research or general
lab activities) until there are enough women around that
they feel comfortable and have productive expectations of
women colleagues. When you have a bunch of women colleagues,
you usually find more than one you respect, and it changes
your perception of the whole group!... When enough women are
around, the fraternity atmosphere becomes a society, a
community.'' Sidner also believes that women value consensus
more than do men, and that they compete with and critique
others differently. She attributes such differences to
socialized skills learned in childhood, and she sees the
same forces at work today in her nine-year-old daughter's
experiences.

     Another woman said, ``When I first started, my research
group consisted of older students, including two women.
Later, younger men joined, and I was the only woman. The
character definitely became much more of a `male banter'
style of interaction - which I really disliked.''
<P>
     Another woman commented on the banter: ``It has grated
more and more on my nerves to hear some of the stuff guys
think they can dish out. Many of the male TAs joke (or even
say seriously) that they make female students go out with
them for grades. Male friends tell me about jokes they make
with male professors about women in or out of the
department...I have heard many guys make comments like `The
women on the faculty are technically far below the males,'
which is patently not true by any objective
measurement...Male friends think that in the name of
friendship they can be as coarse or vulgar or make as
outrageously sexist statements as they like; I think they do
this more for shock value than anything else. None of this
is particularly terrible, but can get annoying after the
first 50 times it happens. As a woman in science, I have had
to develop a thick skin and decide what is worth fighting
about and what is not.''
<P>
     Disproportionate male-female ratios made it difficult
for several women to interact socially with other students,
sometimes being the only woman present. ``As a grad student,
I used to feel self-conscious about joining my male peers
for a pizza. Now that I'm older, I don't care what other
people think. I know I'm not doing anything wrong.'' Another
added, ``Being a single woman is the hardest. Heterosexually
coupled social events are very important for making
contacts.''
<P>
     Naturally, AI conferences are generally male events. A
few women referred to their discomfort dealing with the
conference cocktail party syndrome. One said, ``When I used
to go to conferences, some man would approach me, at first
seeming like he was interested in talking about AI. I
couldn't get rid of him. My fellow graduate students (all
male) laughed at me, and gave me advice: Be really rude to
people, wear crummy clothes, and look as ugly as you can.
Eventually, I stopped making eye contact or being very
friendly with anyone at conferences. That's not very helpful
for making connections in the field, but better for staying
safe. Over the years, I've developed an air of control
around myself and I don't have to hide so much, but I
remember how annoying it was at the time. And I realized
where all the jokes about conferences come from. Somehow, I
did not think it would apply to `intelligent' men.''
