 When a male researcher sent us names of
potential interviewees, he commented, ``It is unfortunate
that more women don't enter the field, a failure I attribute
to poor, gender-biased education in our secondary schools.''
<P>
     One woman described her all-girls' high school and the
stereotyping that its all-female staff passed on to their
students: ``My math teacher, who had a master's degree in
mathematics, advised me against majoring in math in college,
saying the subject was too difficult for girls.''
<P>
     Another woman commented, ``My graduating class in
undergraduate school had 300 men and three women. This
environment taught me to be independent and stand up for
myself. Since gender discrimination, when present, was
rather open, I could talk about it to my teachers and argue
that I ought to be given a chance. Most of them reconciled
themselves to the situation (which broke their stereotype of
women) by not acknowledging the fact that I was a woman. I
was promoted to being an `honorary man.'''
<P>
     Another talked about the stereotype she was subjected
to while in graduate school. ``I had this `Mom' feeling, that
I didn't belong there. Three of us were in our 30s with
children. Most of the others were younger, with no families.
My adviser called me `Mom' the whole time I was there. And
people tended not to talk to me about substantive issues
when I had to have my baby with me at school.''
<P>
     Another said, ``I cannot remember receiving support from
anyone as a student. In fact I remember quite the
opposite - discouragement. About half way through my PhD, I
became pregnant - obviously not a common occurrence among my
costudents, who were all male, or the all-male faculty. They
assumed I would drop out of the program. I also had little
support from my family, none of whom had gone through
college and could not understand my desire to continue my
education. Fortunately, I try all the harder when people
assume I cannot do something.''
