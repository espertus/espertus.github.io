Women in AI <BR>Researched and written by Dale Strok<BR>Staff Editor, <i>IEEE
Expert</i>

<P>
     Recently, a woman whose article had been accepted for
<i>IEEE Expert</i> asked us to use her initials rather than her
first name in her byline. She believed that if the readers
knew a woman had done the research, they would question the
validity of the work.
<P>
     We were surprised. Although we were aware of recent
studies that showed how much women are underrepresented and
sometimes undervalued in science and engineering, we had
thought that AI - as a relatively young subfield of computer
science - might be an exception.
<P>
     After looking at the proportion of women authors in
<i>IEEE Expert</i> over the last four years (about 13 percent), we
decided to take a closer look at the field.<p>

<hr>
<P>
Most of us acknowledge a perceived underrepresentation
of women in science and engineering, whether or not we agree
a problem really exists. Ellen Spertus started her 1991
report ``Why Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists?''
with these statistics:
<P>
     ``In the most recent years for which statistics are
available, women received a third of the bachelor's degrees
in computer science, 27 percent of master's degrees, and 13
percent of PhDs. Not only do women make up just 7.8 percent
of computer science and computer engineering faculties, only
2.7 percent of tenured professors are female. Even worse,
these numbers seem to be improving only very slowly or even
dropping.''<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap113.xbm">
<P>
     Other publications have also reported discrepancies in
the treatment of women and men in computer science and
engineering:<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap115.xbm">
<UL><LI> Women scientists earn less than men at every stage
of their careers, and the disparity grows at the highest
levels of experience.<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap117.xbm">
 <LI> Starting salaries are the same for men and women
engineers, but the gap widens after about six years.<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap117.xbm">
 <LI> Women's colleges produce four times as many female
research scientists and scholars as do coeducational
institutions, and their graduates are twice as likely to
earn PhDs.<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap129.xbm">
</UL>
<P>
     The Computing Research Association's 1989 Taulbee
Survey<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap123.xbm"> found that the percentage of female computer
scientists decreases rapidly from high-school level to
undergraduate, to graduate, to professorships, and that 13
percent of computer scientists are women and minorities.
Only 4 percent of full professors and 10 percent of
assistant and associate professors in computer science are
women. Some schools have much higher percentages; at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, for example, women
account for 18 percent of the full professors.
<P>
     We decided to see how women are doing in AI, a
relatively young field.<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7166_tex2html_wrap125.xbm"> We were deluged with offers by both
senior and junior AI women to talk about their problems and
successes, but while everyone was happy to talk openly about
their interests and achievements, no one wanted to be quoted
about gender-related obstacles they've met. A few said
they'd lose their jobs if they spoke on the record; the
discussion of individual problems is therefore anonymous.
However, we also highlight the work of a handful of the
dozens of scientists interviewed, who communicate their
excitement about the future, their commitment to quality
work, and their desire to encourage more women to choose AI
as a career.
