<P>
     Many of our interviewees are mothers as well as
scientists. One has three children, and twins on the way.
Having worked in industry, she recently finished her PhD.
She has found both supportive and unsupportive advisors and
managers of both sexes; those with children understood
parental pressures and therefore were more supportive.
Despite her busy schedule, she is involved in local
professional-society activities as well as Girl Scouts.
<P>
     Another said she had her child by Caesarean section and
was back at work in two weeks, because her employer would
not allow any more time off.
<P>
     Asked about her daily schedule, a well-known researcher
said, ``I work every waking hour.'' 60- to 80-hour work weeks
occur regularly in all scientific disciplines, she said, and
she expects this pattern holds for many people through the
tenure and promotion years. Science and parenting leave no
time to do anything else, such as sports or exercise. She
said she feels like a field marshall handling logistics and
replanning, or a juggler with plates in the air.
<P>
     Another interviewee has to contend with long commutes.
She said, ``I live three hours from my graduate school so
that I can live with my husband and child. I put up with
many hours of travel and expensive child care.''
<P>
     ``There is no good time to have a family,'' commented
another researcher. ``Life never gets easier (well, maybe
during retirement...) Few women who get pregnant in the
middle of their studies finish their PhDs, but plenty of men
get PhDs while their wives have children. Many women have
children first and then go for a PhD...I doubt whether there
is much chance for a close family life if both parents are
in academia.''
<P>
     One woman with small children advised other mothers to
accept the fact that work comes before family sometimes and
that family comes before work sometimes. Unfortunately, the
children always get sick just as some deadline is looming at
work.
<P>
     On the other hand, one woman said that having two
children did not interrupt her career at all. She was able
to continue to work full time, getting adequate support at
home and at work.
