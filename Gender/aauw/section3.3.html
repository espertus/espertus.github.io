<P>
I changed from being anti-feminist to feminist in my last two years of
college.  I can pinpoint the exact causes of the change.  During my
junior year, a female graduate student gave me a report written a
decade earlier about the chilly climate for women in computer science
at MIT.  I had assumed that women's underrepresentation in science was
because they were stupid or lazy; now, I saw that my premise was wrong
and that women hadn't been treated equally.  Let me read you one of my
favorite quotations on this subject, made by Dorothy Zinberg:
<blockquote> 
As the data from women's career studies and anecdotes from personal
experiences of women professionals begin to accrue, one of the
questions that arises is not `Why are there so few successful
professional women?', but rather, `How have so many been able to
survive the vicissitudes on each rung of the career
ladder?'<A NAME=1 HREF=aauw.foot.html#25><IMG SRC="http://www.ai.mit.edu/latex2html/foot.xbm"></A>

<P>
In the first semester of my senior year, I took a course, ``Women in
Literature'', taught by an MIT feminist (no, that's not a
contradiction in terms) Ruth Perry.  She had decided to teach the
course because when it had been offered the previous year, all of the
readings were written by men, as if men were uniquely qualified to
write about women.  In contrast, she exclusively chose books written
by women.  I was sufficiently skeptical that I expected to read
second-rate books that were only included because men's works were
excluded.  I was wrong.  I read <i> Middlemarch</i>, <i> The Street</i>,
and <i> Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> and wanted to know <i> why
nobody ever recommended these books to me before.  They're great
books!</i> Only later did I realize that <i> none</i> of the books
assigned to me in high school were by women.  This must have
contributed to my falsely concluding that no first-rate books were by
women.  Being proved wrong led me to see how women's work is sometimes
undervalued.
<P>
An even more significant experience was taking Sherry Turkle's course,
``Women and Computers.''  From the readings and discussions, I learned
much more about factors that worked against women in science and
engineering.  For example, I read the ``chilly climate'' reports for
the first time.
<P>
When Prof. Turkle announced at the beginning of the class that we
would have to write a twenty-page term paper, I asked incredulously
how we'd be able to write that much.  I ended up writing over 100
pages on reasons for women's underrepresentation in computer science.
My report was read first by MIT students and professors (including the
department head), then spread through Systers, the electronic mailing
list for women in computer science, and has spread like wildfire even
among male computer scientists - for example, the Computer Science
head at Berkeley (one of the best CS departments) gave copies to all
the graduate students and faculty; I was one of the few MIT students
invited to testify before the President's Council of Advisors on
Science and Technology; I was invited to write an article on the
subject in the <i> Encyclopedia of Computer Science</i>, and My
department gave me the award for outstanding research by an
undergraduate for the report.  (The wonderful department head I keep
mentioning did goof a little: he addressed the award letter to ``<i>
Mr.</i> Ellen Spertus''!)  With the department's support, I co-founded a
big sister program, and I'm a member of a committee on women's
enrollment.
<P>
One of the requirements in the graduate program is to take a minor
consisting of three classes.  I got a minor in women's studies
approved (although I switched for scheduling reasons to Science,
Technology, and Society) and have been fortunate enough to take two
classes from Evelyn Fox Keller, well-known for her work on gender and
science.  I took another class from Mike Fischer, a respected
anthropologist, in which I learned how to study scientists and
engineers, something I'd been doing informally for years.
<P>
This month, I attended a wonderful unique conference: ``Black Women in
the Academy: Defending Our Name.''  There were keynote addresses by
Lani Guinier, Johnetta Cole (the president of Spelman College), and
Angela Davis and panels on such as the role of women as Tuskegee
Institute.  There definitely <i> is</i> feminism at MIT.
<P>
A priori, I feared that I would have to pay a price for being a
feminist, with people being mean to me or assuming that my computer
science research was second-rate.  This has not happened.  I was
pleasantly surprised how many of the male students and professors are
interested in these issues.  Outside of the department, the report has
made me much more visible than I would have been otherwise, and people
are interested in finding out about my computer science research.
While I'm sure there are departments that would consider me
undesirable for being such a vocal feminist, I think this is the
exception rather than the rule.
