 <H1>Conclusions</H1>
<P>
As for conclusions, the simplest one I can draw is that a woman can
avoid harassment and bias if her technical credentials are impeccable,
she doesn't attract attention through being conspicuously beautiful or
ugly, she's assertive, and she's lucky enough to fall in with
professors and students who treat women (and people in general) well.
There is an awareness among many at MIT that more needs to be done to
make the environment unbiased against women, although there are others
who think too much has been done, such as that a physics professor is
not permitted to have a belly dancer perform before the class to
illustrate ``waves.''  Although some women, such as myself, have
had excellent experiences, much remains to be done.
