 <H1>Other Women's Experiences</H1>
<P>
I wish I could say that other women's MIT experiences have been as
good as mine.  I have heard about bias in mathematics and physics
especially.  I have been told by multiple sources that there is a
physics professor who tells female undergraduates that they don't
belong at MIT and only got in through affirmative action.  Not only is
the statement unkind, but it is untrue.  Women's grade point averages
are the same as men's, even when adjusted for major, and they graduate
at a higher rate.  In Computer Science, women's GPAs are higher than
men's, but most undergraduates think the opposite is true.  One
undergraduate woman told me that her boyfriend said she'd do badly in
the introductory Computer Science course.  Not only did she get an A,
she became a lab assistant for the course (and is no longer dating
that boyfriend).  Other women have complained about the lower
expectations professors and fellow students seem to have for them.
<P>
I know several women who have received far too much romantic or sexual
attention from male colleagues, up to several cases bordering on
stalking, and a reported attempted rape (reported to me, not any
authorities).  I once had to call hotel security when a roommate of
mine was stalked at her first computer science conference.  Many men
(and some women) are unaware that this sort of thing goes on.
