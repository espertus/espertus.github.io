When I got my bachelor's degree, I wrote a letter to the department
head, Paul Penfield, from which I will read:
<blockquote> 
I am very happy with my undergraduate experience at MIT.  I have
enjoyed being here, and I feel I have benefitted greatly.  Because of
the history of discrimination against women in Computer Science here
and elsewhere, I had been worried that, at the very least, professors
would have lower expectations of me and would not encourage me to
tackle difficult problems.  I am very happy to say this was not the
case.  All of the professors I have dealt with have been wonderful.  I
would like to call to your attention the [two] whom I have dealt with
most.
<P>
Arvind is my academic advisor.  He always treats me with respect and
encouraged me to take the most challenging classes.  He once even told
me my schedule was too easy for me and that I should add more courses.
This occurred at a time when I had been sensitized to problems other
women have had with their advisors trying to steer them into softer
courses, so I especially appreciated the treatment.  Arvind has also
expressed interest in my thesis and stayed late one evening just so
he can attend my presentation, which was flattering....
<P>
My biggest debt is to my thesis supervisor Bill Dally.  He gave me an
extremely challenging thesis topic and the resources to do it.  He
meets with each of his students - including undergraduates - for
an hour every two weeks.  I have not heard of any other faculty member
devoting so much energy to undergraduates.  When I wanted him to
review my thesis outline before I left town, he took unscheduled time
out of a very hectic day to discuss it with me.  He normally does not
come in on Fridays, but he told me he would come on the thesis
deadline date, a Friday, just to sign my thesis, if I needed the last
day.  He  read drafts of each of my chapters, providing
excellent feedback.  I hear that most professors don't read
undergraduate theses at all.  The fun I've had doing research this
year for him is what decided me to go for my Ph.D.  
</blockquote>
<P>
My good experiences have continued as a graduate student.  I am
treated as a valued member of the community, and professors are happy
to give me guidance.  My thesis supervisor still, Bill Dally, has not
only told me that he thinks I'm good enough to get a top academic job
when I graduate, but he's given me thorough advice on how to market
myself in the next few years to get such a job.
