<title>SIGCSE Panel Presentation</title>

<em>The following statement was presented by <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/ellens/">Ellen Spertus</a> in the panel on
"Creating an Empowering Environment for the Success of Women Students
in Undergraduate, Co-Ed Computer Science Programs" as part of the
Twenty-Fourth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science
Education.</em>



<p>When I found out that one of the topics of this panel would be ways
that there can be problems for women in computer science departments
that men aren't aware of, it made me think of a story I was told by a
woman who led a study of undergraduate computer science programs.
Among other methods, at each site, the teachers of the introductory
courses were interviewed about whether there were any problems for
women in their programs.  One teacher was certain there were no
problems for women and said so in all the ways that the interviewer
asked about it.  The interviewer had trouble remaining polite,
however, because right behind the teacher was a huge computer printout
of a naked woman that framed him during the entire interview.</p>

<p>I'll assume that most of you are more sensitive than that and that I
can discuss less blatant issues.  Before I go further, let me say that
my own experience at MIT has been wonderful and that the stories I've
collected are from women from many different schools.</p>

<p>One issue that concerns women more than men is safety going to and
from labs.  Since it is often difficult to complete lab assignments
without working at night, this creates a safety problem.  This is less
of a problem on campuses that have shuttles or other safety services.
Other solutions are to have the lab open early in the morning or to
enable work to be done from computers at dorms, although this can have
the disadvantage of isolating students.</p>

<p>When women do interact with others in their program, they sometimes
receive more romantic attention than they would like, not just from
their peers but also from their tutors.  One woman told me that she
went for help to the physics tutor until he tried to date her.  Since
this was a difficult class that she was having trouble in, this was a
serious problem, and she stopped taking physics.  The same tutor asked
out several of the female physics students.  This isn't just an
isolated incident.  When the woman's friend was involved with hiring
tutors, several said to him, "Being a tutor must be a great way to
meet chicks."</p>

<p>In other cases, a woman can't tell whether a man's interest in her is
romantic or professional.  Women don't know how to react to a teaching
assistant's invitation to dinner, for example.  Because of this, some
men bend over backwards to avoid anything that could alarm a woman or
look bad.  Unfortunately, this means that women miss out on informal
interactions.  A professor might have chummy discussions with his door
shut with male students but be more serious and leave his door wide
open with female students.  Unfortunately, no simple fix exists to
this dilemma, although sensitivity to the problem can help, as can an
excellent reputation.</p>

<p>Women also often miss out on social events that involve sports or
drinking.  I am not interested in most sports.  I took up ice hockey,
which is very popular where I work, but when I tried playing ultimate
frisbee, I was unwelcome, because I was so much worse at it than the
men.  While some women are as good as the men and as interested, most
aren't.  Also, I don't think I'm unique for being uncomfortable with
the idea of going drinking with male students and professors.  A
picnic or dinner would be more inclusive than a softball game or a
drinking excursion.</p>

<p>Sometimes, women are told by male peers or even professors that they
don't belong in a program but just got in because they're women, even
when there is no good reason to think this is the case.  I'll quote a
few responses that I received on this subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
   The bias of other (male) students was a real hassle for me.  During my
   freshman year, when everyone is "proving" themselves, I had to endure
   many comments such as "who did you sleep with to get that grade?"  and
   "you're pretty smart for a girl". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From another woman:
<blockquote>
<p>
    When I was accepted to graduate school at a well-known
    university, two of my (male) classmates were not.  
    In an attempt at making them feel better while "preparing
    me for the real world", our advisor told me (in their presence)
    that the only reason I had been accepted and they had not
    was because I am a woman.  At the time, this was quite
    devastating -- now it just makes me angry to think about it.
    In fact, I almost refused to accept admission for this 
    reason.  Luckily, I was scheduled to talk to a member of the
    admissions committee, and I asked him point blank if this
    was a true statement.  He explained the admission process
    and convinced me that my being a woman played a much more
    minor role than my advisor had led me to believe.</p>

<p>    I don't believe my advisor intended any harm.  In fact, I
    think he really thought he was "helping" me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure there's a lot that departments can do to prevent this
sort of thing, but it can help to make people aware that women are
doing well.  For example, I've been publicizing the finding that,
contrary to the conventional wisdom, women's grade point averages at
MIT are the same as men's and higher in computer science.</p>

<p>I do have some positive stories to tell.  As I said, my own experience
at MIT was wonderful.  There are several little things my advisor has
done that meant a lot to me.  For example, when he saw me collating
thirteen copies of a paper we wrote to send to a conference, he told
me I should have asked his secretary to do that.  I think many
professors wouldn't have seen anything incongruous about a woman's
spending her time on that sort of task.  At group meetings, it's not
uncommon for him to say to someone, "You've been quiet, but I'm sure
you have something valuable to say."  While I don't have any problem
speaking up, women do disproportionately.  By what he says, he shows
that he's really interested in what the quieter people have to say.</p>

<p>A female graduate student in a top program gave me a heartwarming
description of her undergraduate institution, Southern Methodist
University:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Students entering the university who are deemed to be "at risk"
    (regardless of gender, race, etc) are encouraged to take advantage of
    the free services offered by the campus Learning Enhancement Center.
    It has a director who was chosen for her experience in educational
    issues, particulary for non-traditional students and their "learning
    styles."  The center also employs student tutors (who undergo specific
    training) who work specified "office hours" and participate in staff
    meetings, thus lending some cohesiveness to the environment, as
    opposed to a bunch of independent tutors.  Besides the obvious support
    being made available by the university in this manner, there are also
    some subtle aspects that (I believe) further encourage women -- these
    include the fact that a substantial number of the tutors are women,
    that the University Compliance officer who oversees the Learning
    Enhancement Center is a women who has worked in a role that is often a
    male's role, and that both the provost and the associate provost are
    women.</p>

<p>    Beyond this campus wide support, there is also support that is
    centered at the various schools, including the engineering school.
    The undergraduate dean takes retention of all minorities (including
    women) very seriously, and has formed an informal council of
    upperclass women to provide feedback on how well the school responds
    to the needs of its women students.  However, this concern does not go
    so far as to make it appear that women are not asked to compete
    head-to-head with their male peers -- so there is never this sense
    that women are in the classes because of quotas, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
I want to close by mentioning a big sister program that we have at MIT
between graduate women and female sophomores.  Dana Henry and I
started it after finding out that significantly fewer undergraduate
women than men were doing research and applying to MIT for graduate
school.  We have a get-together every year where the graduate women
give advice on these subjects; then, we match women based on their
interests.  Not only can the graduate woman give concrete advice on
finding research positions and preparing for graduate school, but she
serves as a role model and is a contact to whom the undergraduate can
go if she ever is mistreated and needs advice.  It is hard to tell
whether the program has been effective, but the number of women doing
research at the Lab for Computer Science went up, and the
undergraduates seem enthusiastic about the program.</p>
