I started this page because many people were sending me interesting
comments about their own experiences, which I thought should get a
wider audience if the author was willing.<p>

As a woman just getting started in computers and the online world, I
am both appalled and heartened by what you wrote.  I have seen and
experienced harassment and discrimination, but never like the stories
you included.  Most of my experience has been "young woman, you'll be
answering the phones" or "fox is your last name?  cool, will you go
out with me?"  As an engineer at a major corporation, my sister has
experienced the face-to-face "you can't do this" discrimination, but
she doesn't like to tell people about it.  It's great to see that
women are telling their stories.<p>

As a female student studying computer science as an option for my
degree I am heartened by the reactions of my male counter parts they
atreat me as an equal and quite happily ask me the answers to problems
they might be having!  Keep that going lads.<p>

Thanks a lot for compiling a very useful page on Womenin Technology. It has been very helpful with my research!<p>

While I am not a computer scientist, nor a militant feminist, I am a
woman and I do choose to work with computers.  My computer has become
a tool for my livelihood, a channel to friendship (with people of both
genders) and a vehicle a paintbrush for my own creativity, and a
doorway to endless information and knowledge.<p>

There may well be historical reasons for our "minority" status on the
net; however, I believe it is our responsibility - collectively and
individually, to grasp the opportunities and at hand.  There are no
glass ceilings here.  Only open windows.<p>

Your page offers a wealth of avenues to explore - and I shall do so -
but let us not lose perspective or be sidetracked by the increasingly
counterproductive PC (pardon the pun!) rhetoric.<p>

	I have been reading your paper for the last week in snatches
of free time I have a work.  I felt that it was very well done and
brought up some points that I myself have had trouble putting into
words at times.  <p>
	When reading your paper I analyzed my own history in
math and science.  All through secondary school and my three years at
college I have been at the top of my class.  Many times number 1.  I
have never felt out-of-place in that position.  My peers, both men and
women, are always very supportive and encouraging.  My family is also
encouraging.  <p>
	Needless to say I read your report with the thought that
although unfortunate thoughts and incidents still occur, blatant
discrimination was becoming a thing of the past.  I still get the
typical "You will do so well in engineering because you are a girl"
remark, but that is a side effect from Affirmative Action/Preferential
Treatment.  I realize that the comment is inadvertent, and I
politely correct the individual.<p>
	However, just yesterday, February 8, 1995, the women in one of
my classes were blatantly discriminated against.  I mention the date
because of the fact that I was so shocked and amazed.  My Quantum
Physics prof wrote a particularly difficult integral on the board.  He
then asked the class if we knew how to solve it.  There was a pause
and it seemed as if no one did.  A women then spoke up and gave the
correct way to solve it.  The professor then said, "You guys should be
ashamed of yourselves, letting a women answer."  There was laughter
and then he said, "You'll have to excuse me I am from the old
school."  He said the second comment in an almost challenging way as if
it should be accepted as ok.  I was totally floored.  That same day I
sent him an email message stating that his comment was offensive.  I
also mentioned that he might want to read your paper and gave him the
URL.  I received a response stating that no offense was intended.<p>
	Your paper and the above incident have inspired me to make a
difference when I am a professor.  Comments like the above can not be
allowed.  I realize changing a society takes time, and I must say I am
glad to live in this decade.<p>

Fabulous!  As the only woman in a group of
twelve software engineers/ systems programmers
caring for 100+ workstations which serve 40,000+ 
users at my university, I am very pleased to see
people addressing this topic.  I am convinced that
(most of the time) it is less active discrimination
than subtle messages and attitudes which prevent
and discourage women from going as far as men in
technical fields.

Both your home page on women in CS and the report
you wrote on the paucity of women in CS make 
*excellent* reading. As a (male) CS student whose
wife is a Physicist (where women are even more under
represented than in CS) I am now a little better
informed about the world of CS..

I'm very impressed with the page you have  set up.
I am just starting back to school to work on a master's
degree in computer science, and I have mixed feelings about
how guys in the program see me as a woman in computer
science. Some of them are very positive, while others
ignore my questions or instructions on how to do
something.  At work, I am accepted on a fairly equal basis
by the computer support staff, who know I am going back to 
school to work on the computer degree as well as working
full time as a data manager.<p>

Do you think that it is more just related to some people
having poor interpersonal skills rather than being blatantly
misogynistic? That, I think, has been more my experience. I
have had a professor who truly did not think that misogyny
was a word...his classes were a trial to get tthrough as a
woman (but not as a student..he wasn't a great teacher.)

Comments = I found your page extremely informative. Your
non-emotive, analytical style is a pleasure to read.
Your report on why there are so few women in 
computer science threw light on an issue
that has perplexed me for a long time. Thank you!
