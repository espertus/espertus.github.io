<title>Call for Submissions: Women in Science</title>

<h1>Call for Submissions: Women in Science</h1>

Submissions are being sought for an edited volume from women pursuing
undergraduate or graduate degrees in the so-called "hard" sciences.  These
would include (but not an exhaustive list) biology, medicine, physics, math,
chemistry, engineering, computer science, etc.  Generally, your essay should
focus on your personal experience as a woman with aspirations for a career in
science.  Other than that, you can write about whatever part of your
experience you choose.<p>

You are not expected to write a feminist analysis.  The papers should reflect
your personal experience and if that happens to be within a feminist
context, then fine.  However, the papers should first and foremost be personal
accounts. Therefore, they are also not required to be scholarly (in the sense
that a lot of background research is required).  However, you are expected to
reference any outside material that you use appropriately.  Preference will be
given to papers that follow the guidelines below and develop a point or a few
points well, approached from your own personal context/experience.<p>

<hr>

The following items <i>must</i> be addressed in your paper.  (It is
not required that they be addressed extensively.  They are mandatory
only to give readers a foundation on which to better understand the
points you are making and/or experiences you are sharing).<p>

<ol>
<li> Where do you attend school?
<ol>
<li>  Are you an undergrad or graduate student? (If you are a grad
            student, mention where you did your undergrad.)

<li>  What is your field/major?

<li>  What type of school are you attending (private liberal arts,
            state university, Institute, etc.)?

<li>  Where is your school located (specifically and generally - eg.
            Northwestern University is located in Evanston, Illinois just
            outside of the city of Chicago.)

<li>  What is the approximate enrollment (undergrad/grad)?

<li>  Are there active research programs being conducted in your
            department?
</ol>

<li>  Describe the "culture" of your department/school (If you are in
    graduate school and choose to write about experiences as an undergrad as
    well as a graduate student, you should address these points, as
    appropriate, for both environments.)
<ol>
<li>  How are students (undergrad/grad -- depending upon your
            circumstance) treated in general by the faculty/administration?
            (eg. do faculty listen to you; are students' opinions/
            contributions valued, etc.)

<li>  In your opinion, are female and male students generally treated
            equally by faculty; by peers?  If no, give examples.

<li>  Within your field, are there assumptions/expectations regarding
            females that are not applied to males?  If yes, give examples.

<li>  Within your field, are there assumptions/expectations regarding
            males that are not applied to females?  If yes, give examples.
</ol>

<li> To what extent are women represented in the "hard" sciences at your
    school?  (Feel free to break this further down by race, ethnicity,
    class, sexual orientation, etc. if you wish.  However, keep the focus
    on women).

<ol>
<li>  What is the approximate ratio of female/male students in your
            department?

<li>  What is the approximate ratio of female to male faculty members
            within your department?  What type of positions do women hold
            and/or tend to hold (eg. instructors, technicians, entry level
            faculty: assistant professor, mid-level faculty: associate
            professor, senior level faculty: full professor, etc.)?

<li>  Do women hold senior level faculty/administrative positions
            (eg. full professors, department chairs, directors, deans, etc.
            within your department)?  What is their representation compared
            to males holding similar positions within your department?

</ol>
<li> What are your goals, career aspirations?

<ol>
        <li>  How do you plan to achieve your goal?

        <li>  What potential obstacles (if any) to achieving your goal do you

            anticipate that you may encounter, or already have encountered?
</ol>
</ol>

<hr>

The following are suggestions for additional points that you might
like to address.  Do <i>not</i> misconstrue these as topics in which I
have a particular interest.  This is <i>your</i> paper.  I have listed
these only to help you if you are stuck about what else to say.

<ol>
<li> Why did you choose science?
<ol>
<li>  Was there a particular person who served as a role model or
            inspired you to choose science for a career?

<li>  What is it that excites you about science?
</ol>

<li> Do you have circumstances (eg. visual/hearing/physical impairments and/or
    issues surrounding race, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, religion,
    etc.) that you feel are an additional challenge over and above those faced
    by your female colleagues?

<LI>  What are your criticizms (if any) of your field, or science in general
    (eg. the "politics" of doing science)?

<ol>
<li>  What has been difficult/frustrating for you?

<li> What has prevented you from enjoying science to its fullest?

<li>  Complete this sentence:  "I like doing science, but I don't
            like .........."

</ol> What suggestions (if any) do you have that might make science
        more enjoyable/rewarding for you (or for women in general)?


<li>  Of the problems/criticizms that you delineated in 3, what is our
    (women's) role in perpetuating them?  (Eg. are we helpless victims?
    How do we contribute to the problem, if at all?)

<li>  Are there stereotypes about women in science; in your specific field?
    If so, what are they?  Why do they exist?  Where are they rooted?

<li>  In what ways is science (your field) more hospitable for women now than it
    was 10 years ago; 20 years; 50 years?

<li> Are you aware of, or have you directly encountered, sexism in your field;
    within your department?  Give examples.

<li>  Is it harder for a woman to forge a career in science than for a
an?  Why?

<li> Are the job prospects in your field promising?

<li> Did your primary/secondary/undergrad (if applicable) education adequately
     prepare you for the work you are doing in your present field?
<ol>
<li>  If yes, give specific examples for which you are appreciative.

<li>  If no, what was lacking?

<li>  What improvements would you suggest to better prepare students?
</ol>

<li> What advice (personal and academic) would you give other women
onsidering
     a career in the so called "hard" sciences?

<li> What were your assumptions (if any) about science that have turned out
     not to be accurate?

<li>  As a scientist, how are you treated/received by your peers (eg. women,
     men, feminists, etc.)?
</ol>

Submissions should be double-spaced and are not to exceed 25 pages of
