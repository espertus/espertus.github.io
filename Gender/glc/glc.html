<h2>
<center>Abstract</center></h2>
<p><i>Reports of on-line harassment of women have caused concern to many and 
have led some to advocate government control over the Internet. This paper 
describes social and technical - rather than legal - defenses already used by 
women on-line or that will soon be available. These include blacklists, explicit 
reputations, secure authentication, private or moderated mailing lists, programs 
for filtering messages based on their contents or sender, and public replies to 
harassers. Freedom of speech is shown to be a valuable tool </i>against<i> 
harassment, both in allowing individuals to not read unwelcome material and in 
allowing intended victims to publicly embarrass would-be harassers. The ethics 
of showing offensive on-line material to the author's off-line associates is 
also discussed.</i> 
</p><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Because sexism and harassment are problems in off-line society, it should 
come as no surprise that they are on-line [<a href="refs.html#val">Val 96</a>], 
although the forms vary. In this paper, I discuss the experiences of women 
on-line and the social and technical tools in use or on the horizon for fighting 
harassment. While it is of course not always the case that women are the targets 
of harassment and men the aggressors, I focus here on this much-publicized 
stereotypical pattern. 
</p><p>Online harassment can be divided into two categories: material <i>received 
by</i> a woman and material posted <i>about</i> a woman (or about women in 
general). The first category is analogous to when a woman off-line receives 
repeated unwanted telephone calls or mailings or when she unwittingly encounters 
material she considers offensive, such as on billboards or in conversation. This 
category will be discussed immediately, and the second in the latter half of 
this paper. 
</p><h2>Material Received by an Individual</h2>
<h3>Technical Means</h3>
<p>Answering machines and caller identification are two technologies that help 
to protect women against telephone harassment, although these are of limited 
effectiveness. In contrast, the potential exists on-line to completely block 
contact from unwanted individuals with tools for different on-line media: 
</p><ul>
  <li>Programs to read Usenet news support <i>kill files</i>, used to 
  automatically bypass messages listed as being from a certain individual or 
  meeting other criteria specified by the user. This allows an individual to 
  choose not to see further messages in a given discussion "thread" or posted 
  from a specified user account or machine. People can choose to share their 
  kill files with others in order to warn them about offensive individuals.
  <p></p>
  </li><li>Real-time discussion forums, such as MUDs and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), 
  allow a user to block receiving messages from a specified user. Similar 
  technology could be used to allow blocking messages containing words that the 
  user considers unwelcome. Individuals can also be banned from forums at the 
  operators' discretion.
  <p></p>
  </li><li>Programs have existed for years to automatically discard (or file or 
  forward) e-mail based on its contents or sender and are now coming into 
  widespread use. The second generation of filtering tools is being developed. 
  The LISTSERV list maintenance software [<a href="refs.html#listserv">Lsoft 
  96</a>] contains heuristics to detect impermissible advertisements, and an 
  experimental system, Smokey, recognizes "flames" (insulting email) [<a href="refs.html#smokey">Spertus 
  96</a>].
  <p></p>
  </li><li>Numerous tools exist to selectively prevent access to World-Wide Web 
  sites. While the simplest ones, such as SurfWatch, maintain a central database 
  of pages that they deem unsuitable for children, others are more 
  sophisticated. SafeSurf rates pages on several different criteria, allowing a 
  user to specify that sites containing nudity are acceptable if artistic or 
  educational but that no sites depicting violence are acceptable, for example. 
  Net Nanny provides a starting dictionary of offensive sites, which the user 
  can edit. The user can also specify that pages containing certain words or 
  phrases should not be downloaded.
  <p></p></li></ul>
<p>What is elegant about all these tools is that they allow <i>the user</i> to 
decide what material is acceptable to her, without censoring anyone else.<a href="glc-footnotes.html#censor">[2]</a> 
Freedom of speech is not violated: Anyone can write whatever he likes; whether 
others choose to read it is their choice, part of their freedom of speech. Just 
as freedom of religion includes freedom <i>from</i> religion, freedom of speech 
can now be implemented as freedom <i>from</i> material one chooses not to see. 
</p><p>One of the biggest limitations to the above techniques is the computer's 
difficulty in determining whether a message is offensive. Many of the above 
tools use string matching and will not recognize a phrase as offensive if it is 
misspelled or restated in other words. Few systems use more sophisticated 
techniques. Smokey recognizes that "you" followed by a noun phrase is usually 
insulting, but such heuristics have limited accuracy, especially if they are 
publicly known. For this reason, the LISTSERV rules for recognizing 
advertisements are kept secret. 
</p><p>The other major difficulty is determining the sender of a message. It is easy 
to send anonymous messages or to forge a return address. In many discussion 
forums, a user who gets blocked can get through with a different user name 
(although this would disrupt any other conversations he is in). The technology 
exists for users to place unforgeable <i>signatures</i> on their work, such as 
PGP, which is available for free in the United States (but cannot legally be 
exported and is outlawed in some countries) [<a href="refs.html#pgp">Licquia 
95</a>].<a href="glc-footnotes.html#pgp">[3]</a> 
If such systems were widely used, perfect filtering by sender could be done. As 
with caller identification, a user could choose to block messages with the 
signatures of certain users or all messages without signatures. This technology 
prevents users from needing "unlisted" e-mail addresses. A person could have one 
publicly-available e-mail address and alert her friends to include their 
signatures, allowing her to accept those messages but to reject messages from 
uninvited individuals (or send them to a program or human assistant for further 
analysis).
</p><p>
</p><h3>Social Means</h3>
<p>Reputations and social pressure play a part in maintaining civility off-line. 
So too can they be used on-line, especially in combination with the technology 
described above. Sharing a kill file or blacklist is a simple example. If I get 
sent a message that I consider offensive, I could add the user to a blacklist 
shared with individuals with similar sensibilities. I could set my e-mail 
program to ignore messages from everyone placed on the list, or I could choose 
to only filter someone listed by multiple individuals or by an individual whose 
judgment I particularly trusted. 
</p><p>Alternately, instead of a blacklist, groups could build lists of individuals 
trusted by at least one member of the group. When considering interacting with a 
stranger, one could check this database.[<a href="refs.html#cypher">May</a>] 
This is analogous to people's tendency in the off-line world to feel a level of 
safety with friends of their friends, whom they might meet through explicit 
introductions or while socializing with the mutual friend. People also sometimes 
choose movies or films recommended by a friend or critic they trust. Already 
on-line are collections of reviews of movies, restaurants, and auto-repair 
shops, to allow people to benefit from others' experiences. Systems such as 
Movie Critic (http://www.moviecritic.com) give personalized results by 
determining which users have tastes most similar to yours on items you've both 
rated and giving you their recommendations on items you have not yet judged. 
Similar techniques could be used for rating people. 
</p><p>As Amy Bruckman has written [<a href="refs.html#bruck">Bruckman 
96</a>], whether a woman is uncomfortable on-line depends on <i>which</i> woman 
and <i>where</i> on-line. Just as people socialize in different places off-line, 
so do they on-line. Private MUDs and mailing lists allow a group of people to 
talk among themselves using rules they establish. There are also moderated 
lists, where a designated leader or team evaluates each message submitted to a 
list, only forwarding it if it meets the group's standards. Numerous women-only 
groups already exist. 
</p><p>Most public discussions on-line (as opposed to in the popular press) of "net 
abuse" are not about sexual harassment but about unsolicited advertisements, 
which are known as "spam." Spam is easy to produce because it is trivial to send 
a message to thousands or even hundreds of thousands users. Accordingly, 
defensive techniques have been developed. If the LISTSERV software decides that 
a message sent to a mailing list is spam, it intercepts it and prevents the 
sender from posting anything directly to a LISTSERV discussion list for the next 
forty-eight hours, unless approved by a human moderator [<a href="refs.html#listserv">Lsoft 
96</a>]. Similar technology could allow women who are sent an obscene message to 
broadcast a warning that would advise other users' mail programs to warn them if 
the same piece of mail or one by the same user arrives in their mailbox. 
</p><p>While many Internet service providers will remove the accounts of users 
caught spamming, others have no such policy. Letters of complaint and boycotts 
of these providers has been advocated and, in some cases, appear to have been 
effective [<a href="refs.html#spam">Ragsdale</a>]. 
In addition to complaining, one could set one's system to reject all messages 
sent from an offending system with a form reply explaining the reason why. This 
would cause users to pressure their provider to adopt anti-spam policies. This 
same approach could work for harassment. If psuvax.edu is known as being the 
source of harassing messages, women could choose to automatically reject 
messages from that machine. Internet Relay Chat already supports the banning of 
not just individuals but of machines and sites [<a href="refs.html#irc">Rose</a>]. 
Users who received such a rejection might exert social pressure on their peers 
to behave responsibly or on their system administrators to deal with complaints 
in a more effective manner. Because the ability to communicate with women is so 
highly valued by most of the men on-line, "girl"cott techniques should be 
effective. 
</p><p>Women's scarcity already gets them superior treatment in some forums. As 
Phillip Robinson and Nancy Tamosaitis write in <i>The Joy of Cybersex</i> [<a href="refs.html#joy">Robinson and 
Tamosaitis 93</a>]: 
</p><blockquote>Women in the straight or bisexual adult bulletin board world wield 
  an immensely high level of power. According to <i>Boardwatch Magazine</i>, 
  only 10 percent of bulletin board callers are female. The other 90 percent who 
  are males are eager, often desperate, to talk with female callers. Female 
  callers have their pick in choosing the digital cream of the crop. I was 
  impressed by the male gallantry displayed on the boards (p. 86). 
</blockquote>The situation can be similar in forums not devoted to sex, 
according to Stacy Horn, president of ECHO (East Coast Hangout), which is 37% 
female: 
<blockquote>Men want to be able to say whatever they please, however they 
  please, whenever they please, AND they want women to stick around and listen 
  to it without complaint and like it! 
  <p>Well, you can't have it all. If you've got a bunch of guys acting like a 
  bunch of jerks, the women are going to go where they can have a decent 
  conversation, where they can make connections, where they can find a sense of 
  community. (p. 104) </p></blockquote>
<h3>Making Use of Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>The most basic social technique - often overlooked but highly effective - is 
bringing an offensive message to the attention of people who know the sender on- 
or off-line, causing him to suffer the social or professional consequences of 
his behavior. For example, I received the following piece of e-mail in response 
to my web page on women and computer science: 
</p><blockquote>From: "Alexander O. Yuriev" &lt;alex@bach.cis.temple.edu&gt; 
  <br>To: ellens@ai.mit.edu<br>Subject: Before I read some of the stuff about 
  Women and Computer I though better about women 
  <p>Basically, everything is in the subject. Do you honestly belive in what you 
  write and what you have links to? Do you honestly belive that women are 
  capable do as much as men? (In that particular field?) Really?.... 
  </p><p>Sorry lady, the only place of such studies is a trash can..... 
  </p><p>Call me a sexist pig, but when I need to figure out why the whole regional 
  network went down I don't want my partner to be a woman.... </p></blockquote>The 
note didn't disturb me. (Not only was an undergraduate's sending such a note to 
a published female MIT CS doctoral candidate logically absurd, but it was 
pragmatically stupid. My friends and I will be professors when/if he applies to 
graduate school, and I will remember his name.) I almost did nothing more with 
the letter but then saw the following form disclaimer [<a href="glc-footnotes.html#disclaim">[4]</a>] 
at the bottom of the note: 
<blockquote>For those who *DO NOT* understand that CIS Laboratories is *JUST* 
  a place I work: <br>I have no ideas if my boss, CIS Laboratories, Temple 
  University or Chairman of the CIS Lab Committe agrees or not with what I said 
  above. If you need to know that, CHECK WITH THEM! </blockquote>Obligingly, I 
forwarded the message, with the following note, to about a dozen people at 
Temple University, including his boss. the chairs of the department and lab, and 
the female support staff: 
<blockquote>Subject: You might want to clarify whether this is your 
  opinion<br><br>I received the below note from Alexander Yuriev. At the bottom, 
  he says he doesn't know whether you agree with the contents of the note. Could 
  you let me know whether you do? 
  <p>Thank you. </p></blockquote>I immediately received several apologies and 
disavowals of the student's behavior, as well as being told by the department 
chair that the student was on his way to his office for a talk. Despite the 
intent of the original message, at no point did I feel victimized: I ended up 
feeling great, while the student ended up with his reputation lowered in the 
eyes of people important to him professionally. 
<p>Michael Redrain uses web pages to publicly ridicule whose online behavior has 
offended him. Specifically, he maintains a public list of "lamers" who misuse 
public bulletin boards in their search for pornography or sex [<a href="refs.html#redrain">Redrain</a>]. 
For example, his "horny AOLers of the week" page includes the following note and 
his commentary (in italics): 
</p><blockquote>From: jimhotm@aol.com (JimHotM) <br>Subject: Re: High school girl 
  wants dirty talk. 
  <p>Kristi: 
  </p><p>Where do u live? Let me know when we can have a dirty talk on phone. 
  </p><p>Jim<i> </i>
  </p><p><i>Ohhhh...it's too bad he didn't give out his phone number. That would've 
  made for some interesting times! Why not e-mail him and tell him when you can 
  have a dirty talk on phone. But only if you're in high school! Can we say 
  "Jail bait"? *Clap, clap* I knew we could!</i> </p></blockquote>While Redrain 
did not create the original message from "Kristi," he has created other messages 
("trolls") to catch miscreants. Anyone online is free to set such traps and 
publicize others' behavior. 
<p>Women are not the only targets of harassing messages. Webmasters of 
controversial pages also are frequently flamed. [<a href="glc-footnotes.html#smokey">[5]</a>] 
Some have taken control of the situation by publicly posting flames they receive 
complete with sender's name. Anecdotal evidence suggests that announcing that 
flames will be publicly posted causes fewer flames to be sent. Furthermore, 
sharing a received flame with the public or with friends can be highly 
satisfying.[<a href="glc-footnotes.html#epithet">6</a>] 

</p><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Social and technical means exist or are feasible to reduce the likelihood of 
an individual's receiving or viewing unwelcome material. In many ways, women are 
better protected from unwanted speech on-line than off-line. For example, there 
is no way in the off-line world for a woman to ensure that she not hear certain 
insulting terms, which could be used by her co-workers or yelled at her on the 
street. On-line, tools such as Net Nanny ensure that we do not see unwanted 
words. Developing technologies will allow the on-line implementation of standard 
social mechanisms such as reputations (good and bad), introductions, and social 
pressure to behave civilly (however that is defined). More basically, the same 
freedom of speech that allows someone to send us an offensive message allows us 
to call it to the attention of others, however this might embarrass the sender. 
</p><h2>Material about Women</h2>
<p>The above discussion was primarily about materials received by a woman. The 
other class of potentially harassing behavior is material circulated to others 
or publicly displayed. If the material about me contains untrue claims, standard 
defamation or slander law applies. [<a href="refs.html#loundy">Loundy 
95</a>] If material is falsely attributed to me, secure authentication can 
vindicate me. Additionally, in forums where forgery is easy, people know to 
ignore uncharacteristic messages. The difficult areas are when someone posts 
information about me that is not a lie (which includes not just the truth but 
also opinion and satire) or when someone posts material that I consider 
degrading to women. 
</p><h3>Babes on the Web</h3>
<p>Robert Toups's "Babes on the Web" (BOTW) page [<a href="refs.html#botw">Toups</a>] 
has offended women both by exploiting their name and picture and for its 
treatment of women in general. BOTW is a set of pages that display the names and 
photographs of women with web pages, links to the pages, and Toups's rating of 
the woman based on her picture. Women were added to the list without permission 
or notice. At first, Toups refused requests from women to remove information 
about them. Toups clearly meant to be inflammatory, as evidenced by this excerpt 
from his original BOTW page: 
</p><blockquote>Along with being a Capitalist Pig, I am a proud Male Chauvinist 
  Pig. As such, I have gathered the World Wide Web sites of Women I could find. 
  Instead of rating them on quality of design, I am grading them on a four 
  Toupsie scale according to their personal pictures. My rating system is 
  totally subjective to my personal tastes and whims. If this page is offensive 
  to you, then go to The National Organization for Women (NOW) Home Page and cry 
  to them. Maybe they will organize a cyber-protest against my page or maybe you 
  will find something else to bitch about. Either way, I won't care. If you have 
  a BABE's page that I don't have on this list please E-Mail it to me using the 
  form at the end of the list. If you found your site on this page and didn't 
  like the rating, put up a better picture, your rating can change in the 
  future. 
  <p>I reserve the right to post all FLAMES that this page receives. 
</p></blockquote>To avoid violating copyright law, Toups did not copy the 
women's photographs but included an inlined link to the pictures in his pages, 
causing them to be loaded from the woman's machine whenever someone visited 
BOTW. A few women removed their pictures from their own home page in order to 
prevent such abuses. (Some women had already decided against displaying 
photographs or even were using their first initials instead of their name to 
prevent people from knowing they were female.<a href="glc-footnotes.html#anon">6</a>) 
Some clever women changed their picture after Toups linked to it, causing male 
beefcake pictures to appear on his page instead. New "bozo filter" software 
makes it simple to dishonor unapproved links <a href="refs.html#fraser">[Fraser]</a> 
but was not available then. Toups and his page received a great deal of 
attention, which he seemed to thrive on. 
<p>Brock Meeks wrote a CyberWire Dispatch column on BOTW [<a href="refs.html#meeks">Meeks 
95</a>], which appears to be entirely based on Toups's account of the 
controversy and contains gross misrepresentations of women's reactions [<a href="refs.html#rollins">Rollins 
95</a>]. When a woman pointed out to Meeks the inaccuracy of the information in 
his column about her (whom he fortunately left unnamed), Meeks neither 
apologized nor issued a correction but instead further insulted the woman. 
</p><p>The publicity that Toups seemed most proud of, however, was a picture of him 
(partly undressed) in <i>Wired</i>. My suspicion that <i>Wired</i> would not 
give positive publicity to a male-bashing woman was later supported by their 
treatment of Kashka (Shimrit Elisar), author of the "All Men Must Die" page [<a href="refs.html#ammd">Elisar</a>]. 
They printed a horrifically bad (doctored?) picture of her. [<a href="refs.html#photo">Williams 
95</a>] 
</p><h4>Social Responses</h4>
<p>The fundamental problem is not with technology, however, but with power 
imbalances. That some men post pornographic pictures in workplaces, for 
examples, shows they either don't realize that many women find them offensive or 
they don't care. If half of the most powerful people in the workplace were 
female, they would quickly learn and care. The same phenomenon is at work at 
<cite>Wired</cite>, which is aimed at men and written by men. [<a href="refs.html#borsook">Borsook 
96</a>] 
</p><p>A number of pages were put up protesting or ridiculing Toups and BOTW. The 
most elaborate, by the gallant Kilroy (Dav Amann) [<a href="refs.html#amann">Amann 
95</a>], ridicules Toups and provides the opportunity to rate Toups on a score 
of one to four hemorrhoids. Nevertheless, Kilroy acknowledges that he is 
stooping to Toups's level, quoting: "Never wrestle a pig. You both get dirty and 
the pig likes it." In contrast, the essay I wrote [<a href="refs.html#webwomen">Spertus 
95</a>] includes Eleanor Roosevelt's saying: "No one can make you feel inferior 
without your consent." In it, I argue that while Toups's behavior is obnoxious, 
it does not diminish women. Rather, he is publicly making a fool of himself and 
behaving in a way that might harm his career: 
</p><blockquote>I think Mr. Toups is being stupid to post something offensive. I'm 
  sure his list will be discussed on Systers, which has over 1500 female 
  computer professionals, many in high places. Also, many men disapprove of 
  behavior such as his and would consider him a risk for their company because 
  of his behavior. Using the network to make enemies instead of friends is not 
  rocket science. I have the feeling that in the short term I am more likely to 
  be a sought-after employee than Mr. Toups and that in the long term I'm more 
  likely to become a tenured professor, respected researcher, or successful 
  executive (to say nothing of greater success in personal relationships). 
</blockquote>The most controversial part of my essay was: 
<blockquote>I also looked up the address of [Toups's] employer, Next for Mac. 
  While I would not suggest (or want) them to discipline him for his outside 
  activity, I would consider warning them to be sure he is not using their 
  equipment to do this, or else they could be held responsible. If they 
  subsequently question his ability to work on a team or be a manager, that's 
  their business. (Like Mr. Toups, all I would be doing is pointing people to 
  publicly-available information.) </blockquote>I still have mixed feelings about 
this argument. On the one hand, complainers would only be making use of their 
freedom of speech. On the other hand, one recalls the voice of blacklisted 
actor: "I am free to say what I think, and they...are free to punish me for what 
I say. Let them argue with me...But to take my livelihood away! You can freeze 
to death from such freedom." In <i>Free Speech for Me - But Not for Thee</i> [<a href="refs.html#hentoff">Hentoff 
92</a>], Nat Hentoff discusses the 1970s boycott of Florida orange juice for 
having Anita Bryant as their spokesperson. As Ira Glasser (then executive 
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and now of the ACLU) said: "Anita 
Bryant has taken certain public positions, and certain people who disagree with 
those positions are trying to punish her economically. This is exactly what 
happened during the McCarthy years." Hentoff argues that a boycott for an 
employee's off-hours speech is fundamentally different from boycotting a 
business for the employer's actions, as in the grape and lettuce boycott led by 
Cesar Chavez. Informing co-workers or employers of an employee's behavior is 
clearly different from mounting a boycott or firing someone, but I still have 
qualms about it. I don't know if it's merely my internalization of Internet 
mores or if such behavior really is wrong. 
<p>The feeling on the web is that it is acceptable to contact the employer of a 
spammer (someone who inappropriately sends advertisements). Søren Ragsdale 
maintains a page about "Spam King" Jeff Slaton [<a href="refs.html#spam">Ragsdale</a>] 
that includes Slaton's supervisor's name, address, and telephone number, as well 
as Slaton's own phone number and address and a map to his house. An inspection 
of Usenet archives and personal correspondence with Ragsdale shows that response 
to his page was overwhelmingly favorable, with the exception of <i>Wired</i>. It 
is not clear what the reaction would be to similar treatment of someone writing 
racist or sexist material.<a href="glc-footnotes.html#clerc">*</a> 

</p><p>Whether or not complaining to an employer is acceptable (which may depend on 
whether the message was posted from work), publicly posting commentary and 
criticism certainly is. I have the satisfaction of knowing that my essay is now 
part of the public record and that anyone who searches on "Rob Toups" will find 
it. While Toups has toned down the rhetoric on his page, his original 
inflammatory introduction is available on my page unless I choose to remove it. 
</p><h3>The Jake Baker Case</h3>
<p>University of Michigan undergraduate Jake Baker e-mailed and posted violent 
sexual fantasies to the Usenet group alt.sex.stories; in one of them, the name 
of the victim was a female classmate [<a href="refs.html#baker">Swanson 
95</a>]. The University promptly suspended Baker, and he was charged with 
interstate transmission of a threat, a federal crime. Baker's defenders included 
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).[<a href="refs.html#EFF">EFF</a>] 
Charges were dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Avern Cohn, who said that 
the writings were "only a rather savage and tasteless piece of fiction." [<a href="refs.html#cohn">Cohn 
95</a>] In contrast to Cohn and the EFF, Catherine MacKinnon considered the 
writings a threat, quoting from Baker's e-mail: "It's not enough anymore to 
think about it, I have to do it." [<a href="refs.html#mttlra">MTTLRA 
95</a>] The government has appealed the dismissal. 
</p><h4>Social Responses</h4>
<p>While Baker suffered numerous effects off-line and generated much discussion 
on-line, few responses are known to have been made on-line. One woman wrote and 
posted a violent story in which Baker was the victim, but I think that response 
was analogous to countering pornography aimed at men with pornography aimed at 
women in that the mode of discourse does not emotionally affect both sexes in 
the same way. A more successful technique, that has been used off-line to 
counter pornographic pictures of women, was posting homosexual male pornography, 
which makes many heterosexual men uncomfortable plus fearful that people will 
think the pictures are theirs. Similar techniques could be used on-line. I 
suspect that men such as Jake Baker would be more disturbed by the public 
display of stories depicting them engaged in and enjoying homosexual sex than as 
victims of heterosexual women. This raises the question of whether to exploit 
homophobia and other prejudices. This question arose with Rob Toups and lookism. 
There was public criticism of his body, and, when I appeared in <i>Wired</i> 
(for unrelated reasons), I was tempted to publicly remark that <i>Wired</i> 
hadn't asked me to take my shirt off (as Toups did) even though my breasts are 
<i>even</i> larger than his. 
</p><p>I believe that social means could have been used to get Baker to change or 
remove the offending story. The first step could have been for someone to tell 
Baker that (some) women find it threatening and disturbing for their name to be 
used in such a manner and offering to help him think of a new one. Even if Baker 
did not cooperate, such a move would be helpful in evaluating whether Baker was 
threatening or harassing this specific woman, which would make a criminal or 
civil case more feasible. A next social step might be to publicly call attention 
to Baker and his story, such as by printing a letter or advertisement in the 
student newspaper, exposing Baker to the censure of the community. Certainly if 
Baker can use a woman's name in fiction without her permission, his name can be 
used in non-fiction. More militant activity would be posting signs in Baker's 
dorm or in women's bathrooms announcing that Jake Baker has published fantasies 
about raping and killing women and has used the name of a female student 
acquaintance. Since the statement is true (assuming it has been established that 
Baker's posting had not been forged), this action would be legal, although 
people might disagree about whether it would be ethical, since it could be 
interpreted as an invitation to harass him. That leads to the question of 
whether it is appropriate to respond to harassment with harassment, as well as 
what one's definition of harassment is. Undoubtedly, different people will come 
to different conclusions, with some people "fighting dirty" and others taking 
the moral high ground. Already, a wide variety of women's and feminist groups 
have formed on-line, from the respectable Systers mailing list to the outrageous 
Heartless Bitches International [<a href="refs.html#hbi">HBI 96</a>]. 
Women have written documents on on-line safety, such as Lucretia's "Take Back 
the Net" [<a href="refs.html#voisin">Voisin 
95</a>], and Internet scholar Phil Agre has written about abusive games people 
play on-line and how to deal with them [<a href="refs.html#agre">Agre 
96</a>]. 
</p><h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>While women cannot be absolutely protected from offensive material on-line, 
there are numerous technical tools that prevent them from receiving unwanted 
material. These tools can also be used socially to implement on-line reputations 
which individuals will be concerned with preserving. Because men want to 
interact socially with women on-line, it is unlikely that most men would say 
things offensive to many women in their on-line community, since this could get 
them blacklisted. Nobody is forbidden to write what he chooses; others are 
empowered to read what they choose. 
</p><p>A concern of mine about filtering systems is that they will further fragment 
society by allowing people to only read material that supports their prejudices, 
just as people who read differently-slanted magazines grow even further apart. 
Despite my concern, I have to acknowledge not only that the technology is 
inevitable but that people's freedom to choose what they read should be just as 
respected as their freedom to write. Just as feminists need to treat with 
respect all women's tastes, we need to honor everyone's tastes, including those 
of men or of anti-feminists. (When I told a friend that it was offensive for a 
woman to receive a sexually-explicit message in response to a call for 
friendship, he asked me if it would be offensive for a man looking for sex to be 
sent messages offering a relationship.) I do not doubt that I would be 
blacklisted in certain communities, and I accept that. When we consider whether 
to try to publicly shame an author of material we find offensive, we should 
remember that this technique will also be used against us. While free-speech 
absolutists might argue that social and economic pressure should not be brought 
on people because of their speech, social consequences (reputations) are 
important off-line and should properly play a role on-line. 
</p><p>The collection of on-line communities will continue to grow. Some will be 
feminist-friendly; others will not. How women are spoken of in the most public 
of forums will depend on how they are regarded in society at large. If men are 
overwhelmingly powerful in the media, they will continue to be the arbiters of 
what's cool, although individual women will vote with their feet (fingertips). 
Not only do women have popularity, some have authority and all have 
intelligence. Sociolinguistic Susan Herring and her colleagues have studied the 
language of men and women on-line, documenting and quantifying what so many 
women already felt, such as that when women try to participate at the same rate 
as men that men complain that women are dominating the conversation and employ a 
variety of silencing strategies. In a sublime example of using the master's 
tools on the master's house, they documented such behavior's taking place on an 
e-mail list for professional linguists <a href="refs.html#toofar">Herring 
et al. 95</a>. Herring's other papers explore the differences between men's and 
women's on-line styles and examine whose style of appropriate conduct is 
enforced [<a href="refs.html#politeness">Herring 
95a</a>, <a href="refs.html#posting">Herring 
95b</a>] Social scientists should recognize the Internet as a fantastic source 
of data that can be used to evaluate their theories and as a new medium that 
will transform the fields of applied gender studies.
