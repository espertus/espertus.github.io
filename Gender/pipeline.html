<H1>Educational Pipeline Issues for Women</h1>

[In July [1990], I was asked to give a panel presentation at the CRA Snowbird
meeting on educational pipeline issues for women.  This is a transcription 
of that talk with some added information that there was not time for at
Snowbird.  Much of the information in this presentation comes from Sheila
Widnall's excellent paper in Science (September 30, 1988, pp.1740-1745).]<p>

A cartoon by Gary Larsen depicts a baby in a park crying and two birds 
sitting on the baby carriage.  One bird says to the other, ``It's still 
hungry ... and I've been stuffing worms into it all day.''  I have found 
that there is no lack of good will and good intentions with respect to 
including women and minorities in our field, but our efforts may not 
always be well-directed.<p>

We need to understand the dimensions of the problems we face before we 
can devise effective solutions and not just keep stuffing worms into the 
baby.  Although I will focus on the problems of women, most of the 
statements I will make are equally true for underrepresented minorities.<p>


<H2>The Scope of the Problem</H2>

The Taulbee report shows that the percentage of Ph.D.s in Computer
Science going to women has remained relatively steady at 10-12% since 
1978.  In comparison, the percentage in the physical sciences and 
mathematics is now at 17% and has been steadily rising.  Only engineering 
is below us with about 8%, although it too has been steadily increasing.<p>

Women make up 6.5% of the tenure-track faculty in the Ph.D.-granting 
departments included in the Taulbee Survey (7% in CS faculties and 3% in CE).
Things look even worse when the distribution of female professors is 
considered.  About one third of the Ph.D.-granting departments do 
not have a single female professor.<p>

The small number of women in academic positions means that there are 
few role models for women students to demonstrate that an academic
career for women is possible.  Some female graduate students at 
universities where there are no female faculty have complained about 
their feelings of isolation.  A woman who has been a faculty member 
for a long time writes:<p>

<blockquote>
As a women who has served for many years as a computer scientist
within a college of engineering framework, I have either been the
single woman, or one of two women, within the entire college.  As
a graduate student, I never had a woman professor.  As a young
assistant professor, I occasionally encountered real hostility from
engineering students who felt that I did not fit their image of the
professor.  Twenty years later, I am one of at most two women that
my students will encounter in their undergraduate (and sometimes
graduate) careers.  Yet there are many more women students in my
classes.  There is still a considerable reserve on the part of my
male colleagues toward the hiring of women in general.  And in some
cases, there is overt hostility.
</blockquote>
<p>

<H2>Undergraduate Education</H2>

Women drop out of the natural science and engineering educational pipeline 
primarily when choosing an undergraduate major and during graduate
school.  An OTA report described an initial group of 2000 male and female
students at the ninth grade level.  At the end of high school, 280 males 
and 220 females will have completed sufficient math to pursue a scientific 
degree.  The first big drop occurs with the choice of majors in college:  
50% of the qualified males choose a scientific career compared to only 16% of 
the qualified females.  Once the choice of a major is made, women actually 
are more likely to complete their degrees (45% to 33%), and they enter graduate
school in the technical specialties in proportion to their attainment of
bachelor's degrees.  But a combination of attrition and stopping at the 
M.S. degree creates the second major drop for the women students in the 
pipeline.<p>

The first major decline for women in the pipeline occurs when choosing an
undergraduate major.  Computer science has, in the past, done relatively
well here with around 35-37% of bachelor's degrees in CS awarded to women.
Although no careful statistical analysis has been made,  I have found some
evidence that in the past 2-3 years the number of female undergraduate 
computer science majors has plummeted, without a correspondingly severe 
decrease in other technical majors.  This may be one factor in the drop 
in CS majors seen nationwide.  At the University of California, Irvine,
36-38% of bachelor's degrees in computer science used to go to women,
but this percentage has now dropped to 15-20% 
while percentages of female science and mathematics majors have stayed 
constant or increased slightly (female engineering majors decreased slightly).
After checking with several universities around the country to see if 
this is just a local problem, I found our experience is typical of most
of the schools I contacted.  The reason is unknown.<p>

For those who do choose a technical major, the stage for graduate school 
is set in their undergraduate education.  In 1981, 80 high school 
valedictorians in Illinois (46 women and 36 men) were followed through 
their college years.  These students all graduated at the top of their 
high school classes, and by their senior year in college were still doing 
well, with the females slightly ahead in terms of grade point average 
(3.6 for the women versus 3.5 for the men).  However, there were distinct 
differences between the two groups in terms of their self-esteem.<p>

The two groups were comparable at the end of high school when asked to 
estimate their intelligence relative to their peers with about 20% of 
each group placing themselves in the highest category.  But while the 
self-esteem of the men increased slightly during their college years, 
the female self-ratings dropped significantly despite the objective record 
of their success in school.  The biggest drop occurred by the sophomore 
year where the same percentage (20%) of the men still placed themselves 
in the highest category but only 3% of the women still did.  By their 
senior year, not a single woman rated herself in the highest category 
whereas 25% of the men did.<p>

Something is happening to women in college, and researchers have
attempted to find out what it is.  Studies using videotapes and
observations of the college classroom have found that women receive
different treatment than men.  Professors remembered the names of men
better, called on them more, asked them more challenging questions, 
listened and positively responded to them more, etc.  Both men and women
teachers display this behavior.  They are quite unconscious of it and 
are usually shocked to see it in the videotapes of their own classes.
It is interesting to note that graduates of all-women colleges are
proportionally more successful in mathematics, science, and business 
careers than women graduates of coed schools.<p>

A woman who recently received a Ph.D. in Computer Science writes:<p>

<blockquote>
I want to respond with a few comments about oppression in the classroom.
I think it is very subtle, and the women who experience it have so little 
power to do anything about it. ...  I can't tell you how many times in a 
math class I gave a suggestion for a proof and got no response from the 
professor, only to have one of the nearby males in the class suggest the 
same thing a few moments later and be congratulated for a good suggestion.
I hate this -- I never forgot how much this hurt and actually came to 
expect it after a while.  Even in graduate school, I have seen my ideas 
met with coolness while similar ideas from my male colleagues were 
recognized.  I suppose all of this is what drove me to female advisors 
for every graduate degree I earned.<p>

I have recently attended some undergraduate classes once a week to 
refresh my memory of the class level (before starting to teach next 
fall).  I was saddened by something I observed there.  Guess what?  
The instructors (even a female TA) only called on men.  While I 
certainly did not expect them to know every student by name, I found 
that the only students whose names they knew were men. ... When group 
presentations were made, I was again depressed by the attitude towards 
an all-female group.  The other groups' presentations were accompanied 
by playful chatter and lots of feedback from the audience.  When the 
female group had their turn, the room was very quiet.  It was as if 
they were trying to be more polite, but it would have made me feel like 
an outsider.  The instructor also used a tone of voice much different 
than he did with the other groups -- more like a tutor or something.<p>

Anyway, if I could have avoided this type of environment when I went
to school, I think I would have a much better sense of my own ability
and would expect greater achievements for myself.  I don't think the
women in the classes I have recently observed will think of computer
science as a place where they belong.<p>
</blockquote>

Although she had an outstanding graduate career and shows great research
potential, this woman decided to seek employment at a university without 
a Ph.D. program.<p>


<H2>Graduate School</H2>

The second place where women are dropping out of the pipeline in large
numbers is during graduate school.  There have been major studies
of male and female students preparing for scientific and technical
careers at Stanford (1984) and MIT (1986,1987).  At Stanford, 627
graduate students in medicine, science, and engineering were surveyed
while 1476 students in all departments at MIT were queried.<p>

In general, these studies found women were indistinguishable from men 
in objective measures of preparation for graduate school (women had 
slightly higher GPAs), career aspirations, and performance (in terms 
of graduate school GPA).  They different significantly, however, in 
financial support, self-confidence, the pressures and roadblocks they 
encountered, and the strategies they developed for coping with these 
pressures.  Let's examine each of these.<p>


<h3>Financial Support:</h3>

A larger percentage of women than men is to some extent self-supporting
during graduate school.  (The disparity in self support is even greater 
for blacks.)  Women are less likely to get financial support of any kind, 
but if they do, it is most likely to be a TA-ship.  TA-ships are the least 
desirable form of support since teaching delays acceptance into a research 
group (which is most facilitated by an RA-ship) and offers less time for 
work that will lead to successful completion of a degree.  A smaller 
percentage of women graduate students than men in all fields of science 
are supported on RA-ships.<p>


<h3>Self-Confidence:</h3>

A well-documented phenomenon called the ``imposter syndrome'' with an
accompanying fear of being ``found out'' is found in much higher percentages
of women and minority students.  I think a major reason for these feelings is
the lack of role models.  White males have lots of successful men with whom
they can identify -- they benefit from the self-reinforcing concept that 
they ``belong.''  On the other hand, women and minorities have few role models
who have been successful before them, and they often feel like outsiders.<p>

In questions on the Stanford survey to elicit information about 
self-confidence in academic settings, women consistently scored lower.
Twice the percentage of women than men questioned their ability to
handle the work (30% to 15%).  Half the percentage of women than men 
stated that they felt confident speaking up in class (30% to 57%)
while 33% of the women (versus only 9% of the men) feared that 
speaking up would reveal their inadequacies (the imposter 
syndrome rearing its ugly head).<p>

A higher percentage of women in the Stanford study reported that their 
preparation for graduate school was inadequate despite objective data 
showing their academic backgrounds were comparable to their male peers.
Women, in general, tend to downgrade their capabilities.  Many
studies have shown that women tend to explain their success in terms of
hard work while men explain their success in terms of innate ability.<p>


<h3>Pressures and Roadblocks Encountered:</h3>

Stress is an integral part of all graduate education programs, but 
women more than men appear to experience feelings of differences from 
the majority, feelings of powerlessness and invisibility, and feelings
of increased pressure and isolation.<p>

During their graduate education, women may be unintentionally excluded 
from informal social interactions between faculty and grad students or 
they may get the impression that they are unwelcome at such gatherings.
Racial minorities also experience this same type of social isolation.
In the MIT survey, women often concluded that this was a direct reflection
of the quality of their research.<p>

Women report less satisfaction with the information available from
department channels on the structure of qualifying exams and financial
support policies.  Much of this information is available informally
through the student network, but women are less well integrated into
these networks.<p>

Women experience academic isolation in addition to social isolation.
The MIT and Stanford surveys showed that women meet less frequently with 
their research advisors.  More women than men report that their interaction 
with faculty do not provide helpful feedback on their research projects.<p>
Some of the communication problems between women and their male advisors may 
stem from the fact that women may be seeking a different type of information 
than basic research guidance.  Because of their usually different backgrounds 
and exclusion from important social networks, women often need and want advise 
about the political aspects of graduate and academic life, i.e,  how to ``play
the game.<p>

Women report more often that they do not feel free to disagree with their 
advisors and that their ideas are not respected.  A very disturbing
result of the Stanford survey was that 20% of women versus only 6% of
men reported never having major responsibilities within their research
group.  This has important implications for self-confidence and for
gaining the skills necessary to be successful in an academic position.<p>
In both the MIT and Stanford surveys, women graduate students reported 
less opportunity to publish or less frequently being first author on 
publications.  This coincides with other studies that show that women in 
all the sciences and engineering have fewer publications upon completing 
a doctoral degree than men.<p>

Perhaps the lower self-confidence and self-esteem of women merely reflects
what others feel about them.  Women give their advisors a great deal of 
power in assessing their ability, and women are apt to internalize and 
validate their perceptions of this assessment.  This is not surprising 
since women in our society are taught to be more receptive to social cues,
that is, to be more externally-oriented socially.  Lowered expectations by 
an advisor, whether conscious or subconscious, are quickly perceived by 
the female student.<p>

There is a great deal of evidence to support these hypotheses of lowered
expectations and lowered evaluations.  Studies where male and
female names are applied to resumes, proposals, and papers and then
evaluated by both males and females consistently show that the documents
with women's names attached receive lower evaluations from both men and
women evaluators compared to the same documents with male names attached.<p>

In addition, studies of group meetings show that women are interrupted by 
men much more frequently than are other men and that women's contributions 
are often ignored or attributed to one of the men in the group.  I'm sure that
most of the women reading this have experienced this behavior.  Occasionally, 
to save time, I just ask a man sitting next to me to make my suggestion when
I think I have the solution and I am anxious for a meeting to end.<p>

Finally, women often experience additional pressures that men do not have
to face.  Many studies show that women graduate students report being 
subjected to inappropriate treatment by faculty and student colleagues.<p>
Women students report the necessity to continually fend off such inappropriate
behavior in order to be allowed to concentrate on the professional issues of 
grad school.<p>

Even today, there are still a few faculty members who publicly, or in 
discussions with faculty colleagues, take the position that women do not 
belong in grad school.  There are instances where these types of statements 
have been made in graduate classes.  This behavior is usually tolerated and 
seldom publicly challenged by their colleagues.  Department chairs are often 
reluctant to speak to a faculty member about this even after several 
complaints have been recorded.<p>

I have found that complaints by women graduate students of inappropriate 
behavior by faculty members are often not taken seriously by male faculty, 
even when there are repeated instances of the same behavior reported 
independently by several students.  Because of this and because of fear
of jeopardizing their careers, most women are reluctant to speak up.<p>

Here is how one graduate student at a world-class research university 
described her experiences as a student -- unfortunately, her experiences 
in graduate school are typical:<p>

<blockquote>
I was very lucky in my early career development, because I was given a
lot of mentoring that allowed me to develop some self-esteem.  I worked 
as a computer operator before starting college and had a supervisor who,
knowing I eventually wanted to become a programmer, encouraged me to work
on programming projects, taught me how to write project proposals, and 
just generally let me know he thought I was doing good work.  When I got 
to college, my boyfriend listened to me complain about bugs in the 
material for the introductory programming course, convinced me to send 
mail to the professor about it, and later encouraged me to request my 
instructor as an academic advisor.  Probably as a result of this, I ended
up with an advisor who told me how good I was a lot and kept giving me 
scholarship applications to fill out.  I won two of the scholarships, one
of which is paying for my current graduate work.<p>

In contrast, my master's work was absolute hell.  I had a supervisor who
was supremely inattentive, and even when we did get together we were on 
such different wavelengths I never understood anything he said.  The only
other person there whose work was closely related to mine wanted me to be
his mistress. I was in a different city from all my friends.  I'm not sure
I would have gotten through that if it weren't for the knowledge that I'd 
put four years into it already that would be wasted if I didn't just keep
on plugging.  It's been three years since I finished it, and I've just in
the past six months started to feel good about my academic work again.  I 
would have dropped out when I got my master's, but I was so wasted I 
messed up my job interviews.  I ran out of money, and had a scholarship to
come back here, so I went ahead and registered.<p>

It seems like every other woman grad student I've talked to has also
decided to drop out at some point then stayed after all due to some sort
of fluke.  Are there any of us who continued in school through other than
an act of the Fates?<p>

I am still having difficulty in getting anyone to acknowledge my work
in grad school.  I've gone through several advisors so far on my Ph.D.
research, and the only response I've gotten is polite indifference.  An
example is that providing a financial supplement to scholarships is standard
practice at our school.  But the one time I got up the courage to ask
for it, I was told the professor would `rather save the money for a
new grad student' (what does that make me?)  So I'm mostly making
progress right now due to sheer, stubborn rebelliousness.<p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Strategies for Coping with the Pressures:</h3>

In the Stanford and MIT surveys, most of the comments were complaints about 
the current system.  But there were subtle differences in the responses of 
women and men.  Men often expressed anger at the system and suggested ways 
it should be changed, while women more often described the effect that 
the current system had on them and expressed feelings of frustration and 
discouragement.  Widnall presents two typical quotes from the surveys:<p>


From a man: <blockquote> The absolute insensitivity of the professors,
department, and university to the inevitable depression experienced
by young scientists when their research doesn't work so well.
The university's willingness to ignore all graduate students but
the top 10% elite...</blockquote><p>

From a woman: <blockquote>Despite denials, as a woman in ... science, I had
something to prove -- and yet the most difficult part about it is
that I don't know what it is or how to prove it.  There is just the
knowledge that I have at least one more test to pass than my male
counterparts.  Or maybe it's one more test to pass daily.</blockquote><p>

Many more women report serious consideration of dropping out of graduate
programs.  There is little data on the actual attrition rates, but anecdotal 
evidence suggests that women do drop out at a higher rate.  One recent study
of graduate women in four departments (chemistry, physics, computer science,
and electrical engineering) at a leading research university found that women
graduate students had an attrition rate that was double the rate for men.
In the Stanford study, 23% of the women versus 9% of the men reported that
they thought they were on the verge of a nervous breakdown.<p>

A self-fulfilling prophesy seems to be operating here:  Prior socialization
diminishes the level of self-confidence of women before entry to graduate
school.  The graduate school experience further erodes their level of 
self-confidence.  The loss of self-esteem leads over time to lowered
performance and lowered career objectives.  Women are more likely to be
underemployed with respect to their academic training, and they are paid 
less at all levels in computer science (as well as in all other technical 
fields).<p>


<h2>Women in Faculty Positions</h2>

And what happens to the few women who do make it through the pipeline?
Whether through choice or through exclusion, women hold fewer faculty 
positions in CS and CE Ph.D.-granting departments than would be expected by
the percentage of doctorates they receive.  The number of women at the higher 
levels of academia in CS is extremely low (and almost non-existent in CE).<p>

There is one recent study that attempted to examine this problem with
respect to faculty in chemistry, physics, computer science, and electrical
engineering at a leading research university.  Because only one university 
was involved and the numbers were quite small, it is difficult to generalize
from the results.  But they do not seem untypical of what I have experienced 
or what I hear from other women faculty.  The researchers surveyed 117 
faculty members including five women (two each in computer science and 
physics and one in chemistry).  One woman was tenured at the time of the 
study and two recent former women faculty were also interviewed.<p>

The women faculty members generally felt that they had a precarious toehold 
in academia, even when they were quite successful.  They also reported 
differential treatment of junior male and female faculty by the senior
male faculty members, especially regarding invitations to participate
in joint research grants.<p>

It is common for female faculty who are not in the top two or three CS 
departments to have difficulty in making inroads into the funding agencies.
They are less likely to have a mentor that helps them to learn the ins and 
outs of funding and that introduces them to the right people at these 
agencies.  Women who try to make their way into these agencies alone may be 
considered to be ``pushy'' or, because of socialization, they may feel 
uncomfortable about displaying the type of aggressive behavior required to 
accomplish this.  A woman professor who has been very successful in the CS 
research community writes:<p>

<blockquote>
When I arrived at the university as an assistant professor,  I noticed
that new male faculty seemed to be quietly taken under the wing of
the senior male faculty and introduced into the funding agencies.  When
I asked for names of people I could contact, everyone seemed to have
selective amnesia -- they couldn't even remember the names of their own
contract monitors.  I finally got the name of someone at AFOSR and, 
after several days of getting up enough nerve to contact him, I
nervously made the call.  He was quite cold, told me they weren't 
interested after listening to me for a couple of minutes, and hung up.<p>
Luckily I have been very successful at getting NSF and industrial money 
because I have never had the nerve to approach another DoD agency.
</blockquote>
<p>

Computer science proposals submitted by women to NSF are as likely to be funded 
as those submitted by men, but in many of the other funding agencies, women
are underrepresented in relation to their proportion in academic positions.<p>

Two of the women in the study mentioned above had resigned their positions to 
take appointments at teaching colleges where they felt that they would be 
better accepted.  Given that there were only seven women in the four 
departments surveyed, two women constitute a significant proportion.  I have 
heard recently of two women who have given up tenured positions at research 
universities and dropped out of computer science completely.<p>

Sue Rosser in Female-Friendly Science (Pergamon Press, 1990) reports a 
communication with a woman research scientist that describes her despair over 
the fact that she and most of her female colleagues were considering quitting 
research: <p>

<blockquote>
Despite the fact that I have tenure and am very successful at getting 
grants, I'm thinking of leaving science.  I shouldn't quit because I'm
really very good at it.  However, I miss relationships with other
people, particularly women.  Every time another female colleague opts
out of scientific research, I become a bit more isolated.  I'm not sure
how much longer I can continue to hang in there.
</blockquote>
<p>

The social and academic isolation of women is not unique to graduate students,
but continues and perhaps even gets worse when women attempt to take their
place in academic and industrial research.<p>

The feelings of invisibility also persist.  Although in most CS areas women 
are successful in getting their papers accepted in prestigious conferences
and journals in the same proportion with which they are submitted, they are 
not always equally represented in the more subjectively selected positions 
in our field such as program committees, distinguished lecturers, invited and
keynote speakers, colloquium speakers, editorial boards, etc.  Studies have 
found that when asked to suggest names for invited speakers, both men and 
women are likely to think of only men.  When asked specifically to suggest 
women, they have no trouble producing women's names, and there appear to be 
no differences in terms of quality of those on the two lists generated this 
way.  This becomes a vicious circle -- those who are often invited to speak 
are also those who people think of when they are issuing invitations.  It 
is not surprising then that women often have less visibility than the 
quality of their research warrants.<p>


<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>

Although there appear to be some specific problems that stand out at each 
stage of a woman's career, e.g., classroom discrimination as an undergraduate,
advisor/mentor problems and learning opportunities in graduate school, funding
and visibility problems as a professor, there are also some themes that are 
constant throughout -- feelings of powerlessness, isolation, and invisibility,
attacks on self-esteem, and exclusion leading to feelings of being an outsider
and not belonging.  None of these problems will be easy to solve, but there 
are things that can be done.<p>

Increased awareness on the part of faculty of their differential
treatment of male and female students will help as will providing
opportunities for female undergraduates to participate in research
projects and interact with faculty and graduate students outside of
the classroom.  The Illinois Valedictorian Project found that the 
most successful antidotes to women dropping out of the pipeline after
a bachelor's degree were the opportunity of women undergraduates to 
have some successful professional experiences in terms of participating 
in independent research with a professor, professional employment, 
opportunity for interaction with graduate students, and support and 
encouragement by a faculty mentor. These are all things that we could 
provide in computer science.<p>

The climate for female and minority graduate students can be improved by 
providing mentoring opportunities and trying to break down the barriers to 
communication between faculty and female graduate students.  At UCI, Prof. 
Debra Richardson and I try to meet monthly with the female CS graduate 
students to provide support and information.  There are also more formal 
mentoring programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
In these mentoring programs, the female or minority student writes a 
proposal with a faculty member (male or female) and, if selected, 
receives financial support to work on the project.  A voluntary mentoring 
program for women faculty is also in the planning stages.  Other
universities have similar programs.  Schools could set up programs
to provide mentoring and role modeling for undergraduates and graduates 
at other universities when there are no female faculty at their own school.<p>

All of us can publicly challenge professional colleagues who make
prejudicial or inappropriate remarks about female or minority
students and increase our sensitivity to the seriousness of women
as professionals.  We can also attempt to include qualified women in 
appointed positions and as invited speakers to help them feel they are a 
part of the community and to increase their visibility.<p>

Providing help to junior faculty members equally, regardless of sex or 
race, will help them to rise to a level commensurate with their abilities.
We need to remember that they may need extra information, advice, or 
support due to inequalities or deficiencies in their previous experiences.<p>

There are lots of other possible approaches we might try to solve some 
of these problems.   More suggestions can be found in my report for NSF 
titled ``Women in Computer Science'' (available from Harry Hedges at NSF 
(202) 357-7349 or by sending a request to leveson@ics.uci.edu).<p>

Scientific and technological progress will reach its fullest potential
only when those with the most ability, regardless of gender or race, have an 
equal opportunity to participate and contribute.<p>
