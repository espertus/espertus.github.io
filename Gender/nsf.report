\fBEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\fR

This is a report written for the NSF Cross-Directorate Activities (CDA) 
Advisory Committee on ways to increase participation in computer science
research by women.  A preliminary draft of ideas was circulated on
an electronic mailing list of approximately 100 female computer science
graduate students and researchers and printed in the Newsletter of the 
Computer Research Board which is sent to the faculty members of 161 Ph.D.
granting institutions in computer science and computer engineering.  A total
of 50 people responded with comments including men and women from academia,
industrial research labs, and NSF.  This report contains a summary of those
comments.

The little data available shows that there are problems for women all along
the pipeline. Girls are dropping out of science and math in their early
years even though they do well in it.  Societal, familial, and educational
factors appear to be the culprit here.  When women do enter college math and
science programs, they drop out at the lower levels.  For the few that manage
to get through a Ph.D. program,  they are much less likely to reach the
higher-level academic positions than their numbers warrant.  
Very few role models exist to provide encouragement for younger
women:  There are only 33 female full professors (out of a total of 1189) 
in computer science and computer engineering in the 158 Ph.D.-granting
institutions included in the Taulbee Survey and only 74 female associate
professors (out of 909).  One third of the universities included in the 
Taulbee Survey have no female faculty at all.  What is most
disturbing is that the trend is not positive.  Although there was a slight
increase this year, the percentage of female Ph.D. recipients in computer 
science has basically remained constant for the past 15 years.
And there is some evidence that the numbers may start to decrease.  Although
the total number of students interested in studying science is decreasing,
the decrease for women is even steeper than for men.  Computer science
is not an exception to this trend.  The Boston Globe (March 13, 1989) reports:
.bq
Nationally, fewer women are expected to pursue degrees in mathematics and
computer science, according to the National Science Foundation, which
estimates that only 9,600 will graduate compared to 22,400 women in 1986.
.eq

Based upon the comments received, there appear to be many things that NSF and
others can do to attack the problem.  It also appears that no easy solution
exists.  For most of the suggested activities to be effective, dedicated men
and women are needed to execute them.  NSF can provide the funding and
support to help them accomplish their goals.

Multi-university and extramural programs can be effective in optimizing contact
of women with role models.  A nationwide group to coordinate and publicize
activities might be patterned after those in other scientific fields, such
as the Committee on the Status of Women in the American Physical Society.
Regional workshops can provide career guidance and role models for graduate
students and beginning faculty members.  Networking activities are also
important to combat isolation and might be implemented through electronic
communication and interaction at professional functions.
 
Because girls are dropping out of science and math at an early age, it is
important that programs for pre-college women be established and supported.
Although the CISE directorate may not be directly involved in such programs,
it can provide support to those parts of NSF that are involved in early
education.
 
Activities undertaken by departments and individuals can have a profound
effect on the careers of undergraduate and graduate students.  Such activities
as providing women speakers can focus both male and female attention on
successful women.  Mentoring of both students and faculty is important and
can be done by men or by women.  Given the small number of women in university
positions, it will be necessary to enlist the aid of men to help support
women and minority students.  Women in industrial positions can provide
mentoring for female students at local universities.  Funding is important
both to bring in speakers and role models and also to provide release
time from other activities.  Most women (and men) are already so overloaded
with administrative, teaching, and research activities that taking on an
additional burden is impossible.
 
One of the most effective ways to get more women into research is to provide
them with opportunities to participate on research projects.  This can
start with high school summer projects and continue through undergraduate 
study.  Funding summer research jobs and female undergraduate
participation on research projects would be a highly effective use of
resources.  Research paper competitions and other such activities to get
women interested and participating in research are important.  Special
mentoring programs where a female graduate student writes a research proposal
with a faculty member have been found to be very successful at several
universities.
Reentry programs provide opportunities for women to return to science and
math and to prepare for Ph.D. programs.
 
The most effective funding is that which is tied to research.  Funding is
important starting at the undergraduate level and continuing through graduate
fellowships.  Because of the changing
employment patterns in computer science, post docs may assume increasing
importance.  Special chairs would help get more women into faculty positions,
and more flexibility such as release time from research and teaching could
provide the flexibility necesssary to juggle career and family obligations. 
Finally, the small number of senior women in academic positions
implies a need to help women advance to the upper ranks of their profession.

A female graduate student stated very eloquently the reason why these types
of activities should be undertaken:
.bq
Science's ability to build on itself and positively influence society is
hindered by the exclusion of important sectors of the society.
A woman has the right to educate herself, to know first-hand the beauty
of science, and to attempt to make a contribution to the body of knowledge
of her choice.
.eq
By not providing the opportunity for women to contribute to scientific
activity, everyone loses.

\fBINTRODUCTION\fR

Because of the current concern within NSF about human resource issues and a 
desire (in fact, a mandate) to implement programs or policies that will help 
to increase participation in research by underrepresented groups, at a 
June 1989 meeting I suggested forming a subcommittee of the NSF CISE
Cross-Directorate Activities Advisory Committee (of which I am a member)
to investigate and suggest 
possible programs to increase the number of women in computer science research.
This report contains the preliminary results of my investigation.  Minority 
issues are currently being addressed by several new NSF programs and, 
therefore, are not included directly in this report.  However, many of 
the issues and solutions are similar.

In order to get input, I wrote a brief description of the problem and a list of
possible activities (NSF and otherwise) and asked for feedback on these
particular suggestions and for additional ideas and comments.  This was 
circulated through an electronic mailing list of approximately 100 women 
computer science students and researchers and also reprinted in the Newsletter 
of the 
Computing Research Board.  A few people passed the electronic message along 
to others or told them of my activities.  A total of 50 people responded
with comments including men and women from academia, industrial research
labs, and NSF.  It should be noted that NSF employees are speaking for
themselves and not for the agency.  To preserve anonymity, I have included 
(with a few exceptions) only a designation of the sex and professional 
classification of the respondents in this report.  I want to sincerely 
thank everyone who took the time to provide input.  

This was in no way a scientifically-conducted survey; everything in the report
should be taken as either my opinion or as anecdotal comments from a 
non-random sample of people.  I have tried to include all of the
opinions of the respondents, but it should be kept in mind that it is difficult
to be totally unbiased when preparing such a report.  Finally, this has been
a part-time activity and in no way should be taken as a deep or thorough 
study of the problem.  However, the feedback that I received (from both
men and women) was overwhelming in its agreement that there is a problem 
and that something must be done about it.  Hopefully, the information that 
this report provides will help in formulating NSF programs and in providing 
ideas for individuals and groups to take action.

The first section of the report contains background data to help understand the 
scope of the problem.  This is followed by a list of activities (either for 
individuals or institutions) that have been tried or suggested along with 
personal comments received concerning them.  These activities are divided into
multi-university and extramural programs, single-university and department
activities, funding for students and faculty, and miscellaneous comments that
did not fit into any of the previous topics.  Appendix A lists the contributors
to the report.  Excerpts from two relevant Boston Globe newspaper articles
can be found in Appendix B.  Finally, Appendix C contains a term paper written
by a Ph.D. student at UCI for a graduate class on social aspects of technology
that provides information about the factors affecting the decision of women 
to enter doctoral programs in computer science.

\fBBACKGROUND DATA\fR

The data I have been able to gather is sparse, but disturbing.  If you
have not already seen it, I highly recommend reading the AAAS Presidential
Lecture by Dr. Sheila Widnall (a professor at MIT) called ``Voices
from the Pipeline'' (\fIScience\fR, 241: 1740-1745, September 30, 1988).
Unless noted otherwise, the following data was obtained from NSF publications.

Although governments should be moved by inequities and by the desire to
allow all their citizens to realize their greatest potential, they are 
much more likely to act when a national crisis looms.  The basic problem 
as seen by the government is this.  The changing demographics in the 
U.S. will not produce enough scientists and engineers in the future if 
present circumstances continue.  Blacks and Hispanics will make up almost
half the school-age population by the year 2000, but the two groups
historically do not choose science or engineering as professions.  These two
groups comprise only 2% of the Ph.D.s in science and engineering.  Women,
who are half of the population, are only 11% of the science and engineering
workforce.  Michael Heylin, editor of \fIChemical and Engineering News\fR 
(vol. 8, p.3), comments:
.bq
Chemistry and much of the rest of science in this country have been working
for far too long under an implicit assumption that scientific competence is
disproportionately concentrated in roughly 40% of the population represented
by white males.  It is a handicap that neither science nor the U.S. can any
longer tolerate on economic, competitive, moral, or any other grounds.
.eq

There is a shortage of faculty in technical fields in universities.
For example, 1,400 engineering faculty positions are vacant.  In addition,
the percentage of new physical science and engineering Ph.D. recipients
who have remained to teach and do research at universities has fallen 20%
over the past 20 years.
Currently, much of the shortfall is being made up by foreign graduate students,
but an increasing number are returning home to their native countries.  
Dr. Walter Massey, current president of the AAAS, warns (\fIScience\fR,
246:915-921, September 1, 1989):
.bq
One must consider that only about half of the foreign nationals remain
in the United States after obtaining their degrees.  It is argued by many
who study the problem that this percentage is likely to decline as growth
in the labor markets and the need for scientific and technical personnel
increases in the home countries of these individuals.
.eq

There are consistent reports that the increase of foreign faculty and TAs
has a negative effect on women students as many of these faculty come from
countries where it is not regarded as appropriate for women to get advanced
degrees in science.   Foreign students account for 26% of all science Ph.D.s
awarded in 1988 and 54% of all Ph.D.s awarded in engineering.  1988 was the
first year in the last five that the number of U.S. citizens earning a
Ph.D. in science showed any increase.  That increase was due entirely to
an increasing number of women earning doctorates in those fields that showed
an increase.  

The number of 30 year olds in the population peaked in 1988;  in that
year, there were a total of 9,189 natural science and engineering Ph.D.s
awarded to Americans.  That age group will decrease steadily and
bottom out in 2004, when demand for natural science and engineering
Ph.D.s is expected to be about 18,000.  The action plan of the recent 
Federal High Performance Computing Program calls for an increase to attain
a level of 1000 computer science Ph.D.s per year by 1995 and laments:  
.bq
the severe undersupply of computer scientists and computer engineers
at advanced degree levels.  Computational scientists and engineers are
in even shorter supply.  Addressing the Grand Challenge applications requires
large-scale collaborative effort involving diverse groups of scientists,
engineers, and mathematicians.  The manpower shortage in computing
technology and in computational science and engineering is hindering progress
in these areas.
.eq
White American males are not going to be able to fill the demand; the only 
hope is in increasing the number of women and minorities.

But the number of women interested in science, and especially engineering,
is decreasing.  ``Societal stereotyping denies girls the encouragement
given to boys to try science and math'' (Christian Science Monitor, May 9,
1989).  Girls are being turned off to science even by elementary school.
Researchers believe that the problem is not that girls have less aptitude in
math and science as boys, but that they do not even try.  All the social
cues discourage them from taking math courses and tell them that they are
not qualified to be scientists.  Jacquelynne Eccles at the University of
Colorado has done some studies showing how student, teacher, and parental 
attitudes discourage girls from pursuing science and math despite the fact 
that females, in general, get better grades in math and science than males.  
She says:
.bq
the role that parents and teachers seem to play is underestimating girls 
potential in math and science [...] and being less likely to encourage girls 
who have talent in math and science to go on to develop those talents and 
skills, and consider occupations in those fields.
.eq
She has videotaped a large number of classrooms
and demonstrated the different treatment that girls receive even though the
teachers believe they are acting fairly and no differently toward girls than
boys.  

I personally am disturbed by the studies suggesting that
women are genetically inferior to men in math.  Directly after some of 
the more prominent ones appeared in the popular press, the number of girls 
in advanced math classes in high schools dropped drastically.

One result of these societal and parental pressures is that women are 
indicating a declining interest in majoring in science and engineering.  
This is not surprising when considering that: 
.IP 1)
Women have a lack of support from teachers and parents; 
.IP 2)
As science graduate students they are less likely than men (including 
foreign men in the same field) to have either institutional or federal support 
during their graduate study and are more likely than men to be self-supporting;
.IP 3)
When they do have support, it is more likely (compared to male students) 
to be in the form of a teaching assistantship which leaves less time for 
research than in the form of a research assistantship which often involves 
work that leads to a dissertation;
.IP 4)
After completing a doctoral degree, women find more difficulty in attaining a 
first position than do the men with whom they graduate; 
.IP 5)
Once they find a job, women are less likely than their male peers to 
find an academic job in a tenure track (this is not a function of their more 
recent entry into the labor force, since at least twice as high a proportion 
of women as of men employed in academic institutions are neither tenured nor 
on a tenure track, and this difference has not changed in the past decade);  
.IP 6)
When employed, women continue to be paid less than comparable men.  
The gap in salaries which is present even in the first job, widens with 
age \(em women earn less than men in every field of science, regardless of 
degree or experience level, and as experience increases, the gap actually 
widens.  This is true for computer science as well as the other sciences.
.LP

The percentage of Ph.D.s in computer science awarded to women since 1978 
has ranged each year from 10-12% although there was a slight increase
last year.

.fi

These low numbers are not a result of few women starting out in computer 
science.  In 1986, for example, 36.9% of bachelors degrees in computer science 
went to women, 28.7% of master's degrees, and 12% of doctorates.  Women are
dropping out in the pipeline at a much higher rate than men.  These computer 
science figures compare to 30% of all the doctorates awarded in the sciences 
going to women (although this includes the social sciences and psychology 
where the percentage of women ranges from 32-50%).  For some other 
comparisons, women earn 16.4% of the physical sciences Ph.D.s and 16.6% of 
the math Ph.D.s.  Computer science is not the worst, however;  engineering 
is worse with a range from 0.8% (in aeronautical engineering) to 13.9% (in 
industrial engineering).  The percentage in electrical engineering is 4.9%.  

The percentage of women faculty holding doctorates who teach computer science 
in 4-year colleges/universities is 9.4%.  This figure does not truly reflect
the problem since a large number of women are concentrated in schools without
Ph.D. programs and thus are less likely to be engaged in research.  

For the
158 CS and CE departments included in the Taulbee Survey, 6.5% of the faculty
are female.  This is a little more than half of the percentage of women getting
Ph.D.s in computer science and reflects that either women are not getting or 
taking faculty positions or they are dropping out of the faculty ranks.
Breaking down the figures by faculty rank, 9% of the assistant professors,
8% of the associate professors, and 2.7% of the full professors are women.
One third of the departments included in the Taulbee survey do not have any 
female faculty members at any rank, another third have one female faculty
member, and the final third have 2 or more.

For comparison purposes, the 7% women faculty puts CS departments 
third from the bottom, below all the sciences except 
engineering (2.3%) and physics (4.2%).  The proportion of women faculty 
with doctorates in all sciences is 18.2%.  The figures for computer 
engineering alone, where the percentage of women faculty is about half 
that of computer science departments, are truly abysmal.  A female professor
wrote:
.bq
As a women who has served for many years as a computer scientist within a
college of engineering framework, I have either been the single women, or one
of two women, within the entire college.  As a graduate student, I never had
a woman professor.  As a young assistant professor, I occasionally encountered
real hostility from engineering students who felt that I did not fit their
image of the professor.  Twenty years later, I am one of at most two women
that my students will encounter in their undergraduate (and sometimes 
graduate) careers.  Yet there are many more women students in my classes.
I know, and have known of a number of law suits involving sex discrimination
in matters involving hiring, promotion, tenure, and advancement into 
administrative ranks.  There is still a considerable reserve on the part of
many of my male colleagues toward the hiring of women in general.  And in some
cases, there is overt hostility.
.eq

The underrepresentation of women in computer science and computer engineering
faculty positions is a serious problem.  It is not necessarily all a result of 
bias or lack of opportunity; as one concerned male faculty member pointed out: 
.bq
The problem is having enough 
women to go around.  If only 10% of the PhDs are women, say 50, and if 
only 40% of them stay in academia, that means only 20 women to be spread
around the 150 PhD-granting departments.
.eq
Furthermore, I have noticed that although many female graduate students
with whom I have come into contact want to become professors,  they aspire 
only to jobs at teaching colleges rather than research universities.  
The lack of female and minority role models in research 
positions at top-ranked schools tends to enforce stereotypes and to work 
against efforts to increase participation.  


.ce 1
\fBACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM\fR

What can be done about all this?  There are some things that can be
done on an individual level, and there are others that must be implemented
at an institutional, state, or federal level.  The activities described
below are divided into those that are limited to a single school and those
that have a broader scope.  Both current and proposed activities are included.
Almost all of these activities would benefit from NSF support and guidance.


.ce 1
\fB\s+1Multi-University or Extramural Programs\s-1\fR

There are some existing programs that are attempting to help women along the
pipeline.  The following list demonstrates the range of such activities; it 
is by no means complete.

.IP \(bu
\fBLeadership Texas Options Project\fR:
This women's leadership organization is looking for strategies to encourage 
an early and lifelong 
interest in science and math by girls.  More specifically, they are 
researching model programs to keep girls in science and math courses through 
high school.  ``After that, the choices are theirs, but at least they will have 
the OPTION to choose.''  They have produced a videotape for high school 
students and are experimenting with slide shows and other media.

.IP \(bu
\fBMath/Science Network\fR:  The purpose of this organization, which is run
out of Mills College, is to encourage high school girls to consider careers 
in math and science and to keep their options open by taking the basic 
courses before they reach college.  To reach this goal, they sponsor 
various projects, most notably summer math and science programs and a 
serious of ``Expanding Your Horizons'' conferences that expose girls 
to career opportunities.  They also have a pilot project called ``Expanding
More Horizons,'' which is targeted at minority girls and women.  In addition,
they have been involved in the compilation of a databse of women's centers,
support groups, and foundations, which is now being used by the AAAS.

.IP \(bu
\fBConferences on women in science\fR:
Conferences have been held concerning Women in Linguistics (June 1988) and 
Women in Mathematics and the Sciences (November 1989).  There was also a 
conference on the status of women in computer science held in Great Britain 
in 1988.  There is some interest in arranging such a conference for computer
science in the U.S.  

.IP \(bu
\fBCOSEN (Carolinas-Ohio Science Education Network)\fR: This is ``a consortium 
of higher-education institutions committed to encouraging and supporting
black and women students in the study of science.''  The schools involved
are Duke, Davidson, Denison, Furman, Kenyon, Oberlin, Ohio Wesleyan, and the
College of Wooster.  It is supported by a grant from the Pew Charitable
Trusts.  They are starting an undergraduate women's support group and also
support undergraduate research.  The COSEN program encourages women and
minorities to try science research as undergraduates.  This research program
started this summer so there is no information on success rates or on the
reaction from the faculty or students.
.LP

Other types of activities might also be useful including a national
committee for coordination of activities, regional workshops, networking
activities, and programs for pre-college women.  Each of these is
discussed below.


\fBCommittee on Status of Women in Computer Science\fR
.LP
There is no such thing yet, but 
a model for this might be the Committee on the Status of Women within the
American Physical Society.  This rotating group of male and female physicists 
publishes 
a Gazette to combat isolation; gathers a database of women for employers; 
asks for volunteers (via the Gazette) and compiles a speaker's list in 
order to get more women invited for colloquia and public talks (there is 
still an old boy's club in most fields in terms of men being much more likely 
to be invited to give talks); promotes women for prizes, fellowships, 
editorships, and important committees; and lobbies for programs to promote 
flexibility such as career interruption, part time work, and recognition 
of family priorities.  This group might also act as a ``Finder's Bureau'' 
to match qualified women with opportunities \(em both full-time and advisory.
The American Council on Education does this already for female academic 
administrators.  

One graduate student suggested another activity that might be appropriate
for such a committee:
.bq
[...] establishing some kind of national clearinghouse, to gather
and disperse information on the different programs (both
long and short term) that DO exist for girls/women.  This
could include info on junior high level `science career days'
to special programs for women in graduate school.  I myself
found out about a summer camp for girls in Vermont and a
new program for women graduate students in Boston completely
by accident.  It would be good to have a central ``bulletin-
board'' for such things \(em not only for people who might
want to attend, but also for those who wish to learn how
such events might be organized.
.eq


\fBRegional Workshops\fR
.LP
It may be possible to establish a pattern of local (regional) short events.
One advantage of this is that it provides optimal exposure to the few role 
models that exist without causing unreasonable travel expenses for students.  

These workshops can be either guidance-oriented or research-oriented.  The
objectives of a guidance-oriented workshop are to help women understand the 
politics of scientific research, to give advice on getting tenure, and to
provide networking opportunities.  One female graduate student commented on 
the possible content for such workshops:
.bq
I feel pretty strongly that meetings like this should NOT focus on
traditional women's problems such as child care, male chauvinism, etc.
Rather a major portion of such get togethers should be focused on
sharing information that men in science have been sharing (quietly) for
years such as how to network in your field, how to make friends (contacts)
and influence people (colleagues), what counts for tenure, etc.
I have coped with the traditional problems in various ways and so have
lots of other women (and men).  We can of course share such information,
but don't need a large meeting to do so.  Individual tastes are too
different.
.eq

An NSF staff member suggested that proposal writing skills are important to
teach.  Classes for such skills might be held at regional meetings or in
conjunction with professional meetings.
.bq
There is a skill to proposal writing, which increases chances of success. 
(Most repeat grantees, by the way, send many more proposals than they
get funded). Your notion of proposal seminars ought to be easy to
follow-up. The easiest way is to have a seminar at every
professional meeting: NSF staff should be quite willing to
participate. I will, if asked, for instance!
.eq

Dr. Barbara Simons described a workshop of this type that she helped
to organize:
.bq
In 1978, when I was a grad student
at Berkeley, a small group of women graduate students (we called
ourselves Women in Computer Science) decided to organize a conference
aimed at getting more women to enter computer science and
engineering.  Fortunately for us \(em since we really didn't
have much of an idea of what we were getting ourselves into \(em
Sheila Humphreys had just joined the Women's Center at Berkeley.
Working with us, she organized the conference in only 3 months,
and it was a tremendous success.  We had about 400 attendees,
almost all of them women.  Some of my male fellow graduate
students attended the opening session.  Afterwards one said
to me that for the first time he understood how I felt being
the only woman in my classes.  With the exception of a couple
of male deans, all the panelists and speakers were women
scientists or engineers.

The conference was attended by Berkeley undergrads, women from
surrounding colleges and junior colleges, women considering
returning to school, and women currently in cs and engineering.
It was a wonderful experience, and there was a lot of
comraderie.  Also, I think (hope) that it encouraged a
number of younger women to either enter the field, to
remain in the field, or to aim for higher goals.
.eq

A female professor commented on her experiences at such a workshop:
.bq
In 1978 I participated in a
symposium on Women in Science right after receiving my Ph.D., and it was
extremely helpful.  If this kind of activity is done well, it is excellent.
The symposium I attended was held in Indiana, and senior women were brought
in from Michigan and other nearby states.  Some very successful female
academics came to the symposium, and during the lunches they were spread
among the tables, thus providing the younger women a chance to get acquainted.
Since very successful women are so spread out in the sciences, this kind of
networking opportunity is rare.

I also felt the seminars themselves were very helpful.  We broke into
small groups to discuss various issues, and the discussion became quite
lively.  I got a perspective on the struggle for tenure, grants, etc., which
(not having a real mentor) I never received during graduate school.  Like many
women, I made it through a Ph.D. with a very ``cold'' advisor who did the
absolute minimum.  So this symposium gave me some very valuable perspectives
on academic careers and what it takes to be successful.
Many attendees were graduate students (I was already an Assistant
Professor) and it was obvious that they also learned a lot.

I should add that the organizers of the symposium had to call me up and
convince me to come.  I would not have attended just based on a mailing.
So, to have a successful symposium requires real work and dedication.
.eq

Another model for such workshops is that they would showcase role models
and encourage women to pursue research careers.  Such a workshop is planned
for Southern California in spring, 1990.  Graduate and undergraduate students 
from universities in the Southern California area will be invited.  The 
speakers will be primarily academic and industry researchers presenting 
information about their particular research, but there will be a panel in 
the afternoon about general career opportunities.  As one NSF employee 
commented:
.bq
My view, for what it's worth, has always been that the area on which to
focus is providing and showcasing role models (successful women who are
successful as scientists and engineers), with particular attention to
ages 3 to grad school.
.eq


\fBNetworking Activities\fR  
.LP
Networking is an important aspect of successful entry to the scientific
research community.  One male professor wrote:
.bq
From my perspective, what has generally worked the best for men or women
is networking \(em early, intensively, and continually.  [Women need to]
participate; not as a woman, but as a professional.
Mechanisms that help women network are great \(em but the danger is that
they will only network with other women, which is a dead-end (in general).
.eq
.LP
A female professor noted:
.bq
I personally benefited from being able to attend conferences in my area,
and meeting established researchers.  To be perfectly honest that was my
entry into the old boys' network;  indirectly it helped me get a good job,
and it still helps with grants and awards.  Those students who don't happen
to be on a rich research project don't have this advantage.
.eq
.LP
Finally, a female graduate student commented:
.bq
I think contact with other, more advanced women, would have
been a very beneficial thing for me.  I am very inclined towards
mentor programs, and the establishing of an e-mail pen-pal
system, so that women who cannot participate in a mentor
program can establish contact at least through e-mail.
I think the regional meetings are also a very good idea, as
is funding to get to conferences.  One of my biggest gripes
is my relative isolation, and so anything that breaks that
looks very good to me.
.eq

Providing funding for women to travel to conferences and workshops would
be useful in these kinds of networking activities (discussed further below).  
Recently, conference lunches for women have been tried.  All it takes is
scheduling a room, posting announcements, and a nearby place for people to get
take-out lunches.  Some women at workshops that include meals have reserved
tables for women to converse.  One such luncheon resulted in the establishment
of an electronic mailing list for women in computer science research.  Other
types of formal and informal networks of female faculty in the sciences,
either single university or multi-university, currently exist or could 
be established.


\fBPrograms for Pre-College Women\fR
.LP
I received a lot of comments about the problem of getting young women 
interested in science and mathematics at an early age.  The number of
comments reflect both the fact that it is viewed as important by many
people and also the fact that I left it off my original list which 
encouraged people to write, ``\fII like all your ideas; in addition, what 
about ...\fR''  Industrial researchers seemed particularly concerned about 
programs for young girls.

Several women who commented on the early draft of this report participated in 
university summer math programs for women that were instrumental in their 
pursuing science and math degrees.   Others who had not participated in such 
programs thought they sounded like a good idea.  From a woman working in 
industrial research:
.bq
If the problem is partly that women are not attracted to
math and science and are not even applying to major in math and
science in college and grad school, then perhaps NSF should focus
on programs in grade school and high school.  I, too, participated
in special programs before college, including some at City College
on Saturdays (where I first learned to program) and at Cornell
University during the summer (where college-level courses were
offered to high school students).  These programs exposed me to
people who were doing real research in math and science, and they
were exciting and fun.  Programs such as these, coupled with
role models in school who encouraged me in math and science, led me
to choose math as a college major.

At the same time, I received lots of social and familial signals to
stay away from math and science because they weren't feminine.
Nevertheless, I ended up in math, so the stimulation in high
school must have worked.
.eq
.LP
A female professor commented:
.bq
I was at [a summer program for high school students] in math,
and taught at it for a number of years.  I think they're great.  Mine has
at least five women PhDs that I am aware of.  Since math is so important for
CS, how about also encouraging some of the math programs to have a CS
component?  I think the math programs might attract more women students.
.eq
.LP
Finally, a male professor responded to my suggestion for such programs:
.bq
YES!!  I strongly feel that by the time women get to the
university, it is almost too late to encourage them to enter the
sciences.  Summer programs such as this would be an excellent idea,
and I would be happy to encourage our lab to help support one.
.eq

There were suggestions for other types of programs that might be effective.
From a graduate student:
.bq
I once participated in a program where local jr. high girls came
to the university to see ``women in science in action.''  We presented
workshops and gave them some hands-on experience too.  I have no idea
if this has ``good results'' and I don't know if anyone has tried
to track that.  My own empirical observation was that it was a good
experience for everyone, and reaches a fair number of girls.
So another suggestion is funding such events.
.eq
.LP
From a male professor:
.bq
There is a local program supported jointly by the museum of natural
history and the local school district called the after school science
academy.  They have mentors who are generally retired engineers who
help 1-3 students with projects of the students' choosing.  This works
wonders in helping the kids gain mechanical skills and in learning
about doing projects.

Do you think that there would be any way that this sort of thing could
be fostered?  Do you think that there would be any way that it could
be adapted to encourage girls to be interested in science?
.eq
.LP
From a female industrial researcher: 
.bq
I remember being told in high school not to pursue
my interest in chemistry because women didn't make good
chemists (this was from the head of the chemistry department
at the local university who was visiting the school on a
recruiting trip).

I wonder whether some programs could be set up with high
schools to show interested young women what a researcher
does all day.  For example, pair a high-school age woman
interested in some area of engineering with a woman working
in research in that field.  They would spend some
significant amount of time (e.g. a week) going to seminars
or working on something together.  This would take a lot of
work to set up but might have a significant impact at an
early enough stage to make a difference.  A less intensive
program of exposure (through lab tours or outreach to
schools) would also be a possibility.
.eq

Several people expressed concern about the general state of education in
math, science, and computing at the pre-college level.  A female professor
responded:
.bq
I am quite disturbed by what appears to be
a drop in the relative number of women entering CS as undergraduates.
My hunch (several people I've spoken with including one person involved
in pre-college education) is that there's a problem with the ways in
which computing is taught in the high schools.
.eq
.LP
A male university researcher wrote:
.bq
I've just read a copy of your letter, and have several thoughts.  As a
co-author of a popular intro-programming text that is frequently used for
high-school AP courses, one of my concerns has been the problem of simply
getting women started into the discipline.  We see the inequities starting
at the junior-high level and even earlier.  It's not unusual to see a CAI
class where the boys keep jumping in and taking over from the girls.  This
may simply be related to the fact that girls seem to develop social skills
earlier than boys, and are not as likely to be rude.  Whatever the cause,
however, the problem must be addressed much earlier than college.  I would
suggest a program to add incentives to young women, and their teachers, to
enter computer science.  Perhaps this could be an extension of the AP
exams, or something like the Math Olympiad, but specifically for women
(and possibly minorities), with national recognition of both the student
and her teacher through articles in both computer society magazines and
teaching magazines.  In addition, universities should set up scholarships
specifically for women (and minorities) who achieve high scores in the
exams, with some adjustment for financial need.  Some of the scholarships
might have to be funded by state or federal sources, while private schools
could probably afford them without outside assistance.  Perhaps equipment
manufacturers could contribute to the student's schools, although that
is likely to lead to fraud if the prizes are valuable.  The idea, however,
would be to create a structure similar to the National Merit Scholarships,
but for women in computer science.
 
If we could get an extra 2000 women seriously interested in computer science
prior to entering college, especially through a program that is tied to
professional organizations and academics, it would be much easier to increase
the number who go on to graduate school.  I think that many of your proposals
for what to do once women are in college are very good.  There is indeed
a lack of mentoring, and encouragement for women to seek advanced degrees.
But, we can't hope to right the inequities at that level until the number
of female undergraduates approaches that of males.  Whatever program is
eventually developed, it has to address the problems at all levels of
education, and not just in the classroom.
 
For example, intro textbooks are frequently sexist.  Sometimes blatantly
(referring to programmers with male pronouns), but often more subtly
(using male-oriented examples, male names in data sets, etc.).  Just the
fact that most are written by males sends a negative message to women.
My experience with my textbook has really opened my eyes to the pervasiveness
of sexism in our discipline.  I hope that your committee's work will help
to open the eyes of others to these problems.
.eq
.LP
A female from industry was also concerned about the sexism in textbooks:
.bq
Work on publishers of math/science books to eliminate sexism.  There 
are still books called things like ``A Boy's First Book of Electricity
Experiments.''

Rid textbooks and other work materials of things that boys are more
familiar with than girls.  In school it annoyed me that descriptions
of distance were given in terms of ``football fields'' and weight in
terms of ``golf balls.''
.eq
.LP
And another woman working in industry commented:
.bq
Most of the action items seem to me to be symptomatic cures for problems
that are often quite deep-seated.  As a parent of a four-year old girl who
abhors any book on science or math (the same books that my seven-year old son
read when he was four), I am very distressed by this culture that
indoctrinates its women starting at the pre-school level.
 
I would like to see in your list of action items not only some steps to
re-train pre-school and primary school teachers, but also efforts to rewrite
text books (the kind that show girls dressed in pink and boys dressed in blue)
in a non-sexist manner, as well as a non-sexist curriculum for primary
and middle schools.  Because by the time women students reach the
graduate level (and that's where almost all your action items are directed)
the indoctrination has long been cast in concrete....
.eq
.LP
A female graduate student commented:
.bq
I would love to see a program involving teachers.  Since studies
have shown that teachers are (consciously or otherwise) much
more likely to encourage boys, I have wished that a program
could be developed to demonstrate these problems to teachers,
so they have a chance to develop greater awareness of this
issue.  For example, some studies actually video-taped classes,
and apparently this behavior was quite visible on the tape.
This same tape could potentially be used as a tool to demonstrate
the problem.
 
I also have thought about developing films, or videos, addressing
specific problems that could be shown in classrooms \(em not
necessarily to girls only.  For example, I recently read that
a woman astronaut had, even has? math anxiety.  Obviously, this
didn't stop her!  I thought how wonderful it would have been
for me to hear about such things when I was going through
my problems with math anxiety.  Then I dreamt of having a
national library of tapes like this that could be shown
to children.
.eq
.LP
A male faculty member also expressed concern about teachers:
.bq
I believe that the really critical population to be attended to
right now are our high school teachers \(em even more so than the
high school students.  I am not even sure that we need to go
back much further than high school (9th grade) to begin to make a
dent in the problem you discussed in your paper.

But with all of the special programs that we may establish, it
would seem to me that it is the math and science teachers that our
students have in the classroom, especially the women (if we are
going to attract more women) that have the greatest potential to
address the issues you presented. [...] I think the primary point of 
attack should be the high schools \(em with at LEAST as much attention 
given to the teachers as the students.
.eq

Although there was agreement that pipeline programs are important, there was
not agreement on which parts of the pipeline were most important.
One woman in industry wrote:
.bq
I noticed though that you only target women who are already in
science and engineering graduate programs.  In my opinion those have
already crossed the main barrier.  If we want to see the number of
women increase in those areas I believe we should start at an
earlier stage, namely high school and early college years.  This is
when young girls are drifted away from hard sciences due to social
pressures.  If we can give them enough support then to counteract
the pressure from their peers and families (sometimes), I believe
this is the most important role and they will be able to take care
of themselves from there on (with maybe less support later).
From my experience as an undergrad/grad student in engineering/
computer science the hard decisions are made in the undergrad years,
the support from my family was the main thing that made all other
social pressures completely frivolous (all women in my family have
university degrees).  I like the idea of women speaker series, I
believe they would be more effective if given to high schoolers and
undergrads.
.eq
.LP
The importance of the earlier years was stressed by a female researcher:
.bq
I believe that most attitudes (intellectual inquisitiveness,
self-worth, etc.) are pretty well developed by the age of 5 or so,
and the unfortunate discouragement that girls receive in schools
only exacerbates beliefs and attitudes developed in the home, in
child care, and in pre-schools or kindergartens.
All those programs addressed at female grad students assume that
you have the female students in the first place.
If we REALLY want to make a difference we have to get them early.
We have to change the attitudes of the children and those who influence
them at such a tender age.  This means that we have to get into the
home.  We have to reach the parents & teachers of these children,  and
the children themselves.  It seems to me that this means that efforts
must go into reaching NON-technical, NON-scientific people.
[...]
Perhaps putting some emphasis on programs to reach the future elementary-
and pre-school teachers would be more helpful.
Support for girls in sciences in the lower grades (whenever they start
to teach sciences) might help.  Even paper dolls that have females
dressed as doctors, civil engineers and airline pilots would help.
Saturday morning cartoons, kids' learning-to-read  books,  anything
that gets the message across early- is it possible for the feds to
support such things?

\fB\s+1Single University or Department Programs\fR\s-1

Besides these extramural programs, there are many possible activities on
a smaller scale that can be undertaken by single universities and departments
and by a few individuals.  One example of such a university program has been
started recently at Douglass College, one of the Rutger's University
colleges and the largest women's college in the United States.  This 
program is attempting to encourage women students to enter fields of 
mathematics and science that have been traditionally male-dominated.
There are several special programs in the Douglass Project for Rutger's
Women in Mathematics and Science including:
.IP
\(bu A residence hall for women mathematics and science students at both
the undergraduate and graduate level.
.IP
\(bu A residential summer institute for girls in their junior year of
high school.
.IP
\(bu Career workshops.
.IP
\(bu Information on research and internship opportunities.
.IP
\(bu Study groups.
.LP

It is interesting that the majority of women mathematicians and
scientists in the past have come from women's colleges.  As noted earlier,
Mills College has been very active in providing such programs.  But smaller
scale efforts can be established at any university.


\fBWomen Speakers Series\fR.
.LP
This has been very successful in other fields such as physics and biology and
relatively low-cost.  It not only provides role models for women students,
but it focuses both male and female attention on successful women.
Female graduate students have especially enjoyed the opportunity to interact
with the speaker informally after the talk (e.g., at dinner).  Female 
professors who have organized such activities in fields other than CS have 
personally reported to me tremendous enthusiasm for these activities by the 
female graduate students. 

Several people commented on this proposal.  From a male faculty member:
.bq
YES!!  This would be a great idea.  We have an active speaker program,
but we probably have only had 4 women speak in as many years.  NSF
funding of women speakers would be an excellent idea.  Where can we sign up?
.eq

And from a female graduate student:
.bq
I am especially enthusiastic about [...] women speakers.
.eq

Another male faculty member noted:
.bq
I saw your article about ways to encourage more women in computing.  I
liked the ideas \(em particularly about having a Women's Speaker Series.
I doubt that anyone here has the energy to organize another series of
talks, but we are always looking for more speakers for the research
colloquium and for the IEEE student chapter.  If you ever do get a
list of women speakers (particularly speakers from the [...] area),
we would be delighted to invite some to come here.
.eq

Finally, a female professor commented:
.bq
I personally had planned to organize a role models' speaker series here at
the University of [...], coupled with a panel at the end of the series
that covered very pragmatic topics, such as how to interview well,
how to apply for grants, how to get tenure, how to pick a mentor,
what qualities are important in a mentor and so forth.  Money to fly in
the role models would obviously be crucial to such a program.
.eq

\fBMentoring Activities\fR  
.LP
With the current small number 
of women in faculty positions, mentoring and providing role models assumes 
great importance.  Lack of role models is an important aspect of the
reason why women do not enter certain fields.  There is, of course, a lot 
of informal mentoring that is always going on.  A female professor reports:
.bq
Within our department, there are more roadblocks for female graduate
students than there should be.  (i.e. there are several key male
faculty members who are not very enlightened, even though some of
them would like to believe they are.)  Again, I haven't had time
to really work on the problem.  I've provided some informal
mentoring to a few of the grad students; since it doesn't solve
the problems, it isn't generally very effective.
.eq
Another female university researcher noted:
.bq
Unfortunately, I don't feel that a great deal is done for women
explicitly (or for that matter for anyone else either), in terms of
being supportive through difficult times.  There is no real mentoring.
There is no effort to recognize that different groups of people
(women or other  minorities) might approach CS research
differently from white males.  [...]

I would like there to have been more mentoring or advising by women of 
women, but that was not available.  I believe that a regular meeting of 
women, led by a faculty member who had an interest in cultivating and 
currying the women students would have made a huge difference to me.
.eq

The importance of mentoring and role models cannot be stressed too much.
One female student, a senior at MIT who is planning to go on for a Ph.D.,
wrote about her experience in a summer job working for a female manager who 
she described as:
.bq
one of the most respected people in the company.  I had never expected
that having a female role model would change the way I felt about myself,
but it did.
.eq

Mentoring can involve providing help for students or for beginning
faculty members.  With respect to providing mentoring for faculty, some
universities formally or informally provide mentors for junior faculty
women.  One female faculty member suggested having meetings for junior
faculty women on arrival (and perhaps throughout) that explicitly address
how to ``play the game'' (e.g., get papers published, research funded,
colleagues to listen).  Some universities have formal assignments of
mentors to junior faculty.
.
Programs can also be established to provide mentoring for undergraduate
and graduate students.  A female professor suggested that ways be
provided
.bq
for women science students to interact closely with the people who
have gone before; e.g., provide a `database' of students who have taken
certain courses (especially the ones that tend to be discouraging) who are
willing to talk about how they managed.
.eq
This might be broadened to providing mentors to new students from the pool 
of experienced and successful students and faculty members.  Both student
and faculty mentors for new women students are useful;  they can provide 
different types of information and support.  One female graduate student 
suggested:
.bq
In the military, when you are reassigned to a new base, you
are ``assigned'' to another military member who is your sponsor
for the first several months until you get acclimated to the
new base, surrounding area, etc.  I think the graduate
students should have a similar program.  Not so much to handle
the housing transition, but to provide the ``who to ask what questions''
information.  It would be nice to be in close contact with someone
who has already successfully completed some of the tasks you are
facing with great apprehension.  I think this might also provide an
opportunity for males who are willing to participate to
develop an appreciation for different but acceptable needs that
women graduate students (and future colleagues) are facing.
.eq
.LP
A woman from industry commented:
.bq
I think all the proposals are good ideas.  Although I do think we
need to increase the pool or pipeline of women coming from high schools,
I think we could do a lot to increase the numbers of women and minorities
who decide to stay in technical fields after say the freshman year and
who decide to stay for MS's and PhD's.  I think the mentoring and
networking proposals are particularly important.  It is so common
for us ``affected group'' members to feel like maybe we AREN'T really
good enough.  I think we forget our own roles as mentors and don't get
enough positive reinforcement by potential mentors.
.eq
.LP
Given that the latest Taulbee survey shows a very small number of women in
CS faculty positions at research universities and one third of the universities
without a single female CS faculty member, the problem of how to provide enough
mentors becomes important.  A female faculty member comments:
.bq
One problem I've found [...] is that the most precious resource
in addressing this problem is the few women in the field.  Hence
I think it is essential that our male colleagues join in helping
to solve this problem. How to enlist their aid is not so clear
(aside from the few who already are willing).
.eq
.LP
I believe that there are many men who would be interested in helping
provide support and opportunities for women and minorities if we, in turn,
provide them with ideas and information about how to do this.  Some evidence 
of this assertion is the support expressed by male faculty members who 
responded to my request for comments and ideas.  One man wrote:
.bq
Our current faculty ratio seems about typical (1 computer science and
2 computer engineering women out of a total of about 24).  Our student
ratios also seem to agree with what you report (about 30% female
undergrad, falling off rapidly in the MS and PhD programs, with more
women in CIS than CE).

If you think of anything we can do to improve the situation here, let
us know.  (We're almost all assistant professors, which means that we
don't have the time for really labor-intensive activities, but we'd
all like the ratios to improve.)
.eq
.LP
A female graduate student responded:
.bq
About the mentor and tutor programs:  I would like to
see significant participation on the part of men as mentors
and tutors.  My experience in [... area of computer science], which is
tremendously male-dominated, is that the men have not
explicitly thought about sexism in science and what to
do about it, but when it is brought to their attention,
they do not have any inherent objection to being involved
in the fixing.  They do have a hard time imagining a way
to fit themselves in; and they take no initiative in finding
a way.  So I think the NSF should outline to them in a simple
way the nature of the problem and exactly what they can do
to help.
.eq
One female industrial researcher noted some of the problems female students
and male faculty members sometimes have in finding appropriate ways of 
interacting:
.bq
Sexist attitudes, where
they are pervasive, are as elusive as the air we breath and very hard
to change.  Perhaps the NSF could fund studies on group dynamics that
could be applied to teaching faculty non-sexist methods of mentoring,
and ways of intervening in group behavior where sexism is expressed by
others.  Sometimes just intellectual bullying can turn women off, even
when practiced uniformly toward men and women.  Changing the social
atmosphere is very important and can have very large effects.
Sometimes it only takes one person to speak up or to challenge someone
else's bullyism (sexism) in order to change things in a big way.
Also, NSF could fund ethical workshops and/or seminars on what
constitutes sexual harassment.  The distinction between harassment and
desire for personal involvements are sometimes difficult to track.
It's not surprising that men are sometimes confused.  Sometimes WE are too.

Another important way to provide more mentors is to take advantage of 
female researchers who are not at universities.  One woman from industry
reports:
.bq
As head of recruiting for the SUNY-Binghamton alumni association in the
DC area, I have set up a tutoring/mentoring program with local high schools.
Alums from SUNY-B are working with students to help them in whatever the
school perceives as the greatest need:  tutoring, helping them decide whether
to go to college or what college to choose, helping prepare for the SATs,
for example.  The high schools we have targeted are those with large
percentages of minorities.
.eq
.LP
Another female industrial researcher reported:
.bq
Recently a group of women post-PhDs have held a meeting for all the women
PhD students at [...] in CS. [...]

Anyway, the idea was to give ``advice'' \(em how to get through
the PhD program, words of wisdom, etc. The goal: to encourage
women to stick it through and finish the PhD.  The motivation
came from reading that report about women in the sciences and
how a major attrition point was between the MS and PhD levels.

I think we plan on holding this as a yearly event. It was very
successful too. We had about 10 students and 6 post-PhDs. It
was informal but organized.  Lots of heart to heart....
.eq

One male faculty member noted the importance of providing mentors to
faculty in high schools and in universities with less well-developed research
programs.
.bq
We need to find a way not just to accomodate
students, but to give faculty (principally high school faculty) a
chance at having a mentor perhaps every five years or so.
.eq
I am aware of several informal and formal mentoring relationships between
faculty at small, primarily women's colleges and nearby research universities
that appear to be very successful.

Another way to solve the problem of a shortage of mentors is to plan
group activities where one or several women and men can provide support to
many students.  Regional activities and meetings were discussed above.
Similar types of activities could be held at a single university.  We hold
monthly luncheons at UCI for female CS graduate students where visitors and the
local female faculty members discuss topics such as how to be successful in
graduate school, recruiting, how to get tenure, tips on writing research
papers, tips on giving conference presentations, grantsmanship, etc.  There
are some strictly women's issues discussed, but more emphasis is placed on
the general information needed to be successful in a research career.

A female professor described some activities at her university:
.bq
  - A couple of times
a semester the technical women in the School of Computer Science
at [...] get together in the evening.  Sometimes we order in, sometimes
it's pot luck.  Usually there's no formal agenda but some
professional topic becomes the center of conversation.  Even more
informally, some of the women at [...]
get together for lunch every couple of months.  This sounds like
a pretty small deal \(em but it seems to generate a lot of good
feeling.
 
  - Reading groups.  [...] also has a reading group on gender issues.  It
meets roughly monthly and the participation cuts across science
and engineering.
 
  - [...] has an associate provost who holds meetings of students with the
ability to go to graduate school; in many cases it hasn't occurred
to them that this is an option.  This clearly benefits women.  She
also held a get-acquainted meeting this fall in conjunction with
the Society of Women Engineers.
.eq

.LP
Another female faculty member described an interesting way to provide 
a graphic point about the possibility of combining career and family:
.bq
We have a group called Society for Women Engineers at [... University].  
These are
mostly undergraduates.  Each year they hold an orientation meeting for
accepted incoming students to encourage them to attend [...].  I usually
speak at this meeting.   I find that this meeting introduces them to women
in the school (and faculty)  before they arrive and thus, when they arrive
they already have some link to other women for help.  For example, I always
take this opportunity to let them know they can come talk to me once they are
here and I find that many students do remember this meeting and do come talk
to me.  I sometimes bring my children to this meeting so that students can
see that they can be engineers and humans too.  They always remember this
when they talk to me later.  This meeting primarily discusses what it is
like to be a woman in the engineering field.
.eq
.LP
Prof. Lori Clarke, at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, recently set
up a panel during their ``Civility Week.''  These are her observations about
that forum:
.bq
Immediately after I announced that I would be holding a forum on ``Why
Mostly White Males Go Into Computer Science'' my e-mail was humming.
MANY students sent me mail with their thoughts on the subject and one of
our minority students agreed to speak on minority concerns. I was told by
several graduate students that the announcement alone increased awareness
and started people talking about the problems.

The actual forum was packed and discussion went for over two hours.
Faculty and students came from Smith and Amherst College as well.
I started by presenting statistics, describing the national situation and 
comparing it to what is happening in mathematics and business. This provoked
a lot of discussion about why the statistics were the way they are. I also 
gave the statistics about our department, which although better than the 
national statistics, are still not great. I then discussed some of my 
observations and some of the problems that had been reported to me.

The minority student spoke about his observations. He pointed out that
computer science is not a hospitable field for someone who is poor and must
work, and perhaps maintain a minimum number of credits to be eligible for
financial support. Our courses are very demanding time-wise and there is no
lab credit given for the long hours that must be spent at a machine. This
is in contrast to engineering or the sciences, which give lab credit, or
business, which does not require laboratory time. He also noted that poor
students can not buy pc's and thus must often wait to get
terminal/workstation access, which can be difficult to arrange around a work
schedule.

Another problem that he pointed out was that black organizations
on campuses did not encourage students to pursue a career in science.
Many felt that business was the best route for providing a strong economic
base for the black community in the future. Another problem is that
minority students more frequently come from urban areas with poor high
schools and thus are not prepared to pursue a career in mathematics
or science.

Our discussion about possible improvements included the following:

.IP
-\fIfaculty should be aware of the strong cultural bias against women
and minorities pursuing a career in science. To counteract this bias they
should:
.RS
.IP
\fIBe sure to take the time to encourage women and minorities who are doing
well in their classes,
 
.IP
\fIAvoid using male pronouns for all figures of authority or
intelligence,
 
.IP
\fIRealize that aggressively challenging a student may have a negative
effect if they lack self confidence,

.IP 
\fIChoose scenarios that will be relevant to minorities and women.
Although much of computer science funding comes from the DOD, many find
military oriented scenarios (e.g., mobile robots) offensive or
uninspiring and would prefer scenarios that indicate more humanitarian
applications( e.g., assistance to the handicapped),
.RE
.LP
 
.IP
-\fITo encourage women and minorities to enter or remain in the field:
.RS
 
.IP
\fIour female graduate students have formed a support group to meet with
and mentor undergraduate women in computer science,
 
.IP
\fIthe female faculty have set up a few informal meetings with the female
undergraduates and graduate students to discuss issues and provide
support and guidance. Our first meeting with undergraduate women is
next week to discuss career options in computer science,
 
.IP
\fIa group, of mostly graduate students, is looking into a summer mentor
program to help attract minority students to the department.
.RE
 
\fIThere have also been some other suggestions, such as requesting industrial
support for fellowships for minorities and women and meeting with
the minority organizations on campus, that are still being
pursued. We also need to look at restructuring our laboratory courses so
our courses can be more accessible to the poor.
.eq

The enthusiasm and participation in this forum demonstrates that there is a
wellspring of concern and interest in these problems that can and should be 
tapped.

Another activity I heard about recently was an informal class on 
writing papers for publication given by a female professor for women graduate
students.  At the end of the class, several of the papers were good enough
to be published.  Other women have held seminars and classes on Women
in Science that usually span all the sciences.  One female faculty member
started a ``Women in Science and Technology Program'' in which female faculty
in the sciences went to visit dormitories after dinner and discussed things 
like how to get into summer research and how to orchestrate a graduate career.
One person reported about a science mentoring group at a university that meets 
weekly and includes local industrial researchers.  

There are obviously a large number of activities that one could come up with 
of this type.  Funding support in the form of release time from other 
activities will most likely be required.  Most women (and men) are already so 
overloaded with administrative, teaching, and research activities that taking 
on an additional load is impossible.  By allowing mentoring activities to 
replace other types of administrative and teaching activities, more men and 
women would be able to participate.


\fBResearch Opportunities for Students\fR
.LP
One of the most important ways to get women interested in pursuing research
careers is to provide opportunities for them to work on real research
projects.  A female professor recalled:
.bq
Working on a research project is one of the things that convinced
me, as an undergraduate, that I wanted to be involved in computing research.
.eq

Another female faculty member remarked:
.bq
From my observations of women students I'd say getting them actively
involved in all aspects of research (participating in research
seminars, giving talks locally and then at conferences, working on
projects) and teaching (being TFs) earlier (as undergraduates, no
later than their junior years) is very important. 
.eq
.LP
One way to provide such opportunities is by funding summer research jobs
for students \(em starting with high school students.
A female graduate student suggests:
.bq
I would like to see a massive summer research program
set up for women at all levels.  Stipends should be
provided to the participants.
.eq
.LP
One university provides special incentives for female students to write
research papers.  A student reported on this:
.bq 
I would like to see the NSF provide funds to be used
as prize money for competitions.  We had a competition
here recently in which women from engineering, math
and physical and natural sciences gave 20 minute
talks about their original research.  It was great.  
.eq
A female professor described the same program:
.bq
There is a group on campus that sponsors a ``colloquium'' for
female graduate students in the sciences, approximately once per year,
at which the students present their research, and 1-2 awards are
given for the best talks.  
.eq

Just as the current NSF Research Opportunities for Undergraduates Program 
encourages the participation of undergrads in research by adding extra money 
onto grants for them, extra money might be added to grants for hiring female 
RAs.  A male faculty member commented on the current program:
.bq 
I am pushing this program with several undergraduates right now.  It
seems to be an excellent idea, and a great motivator.  One wrinkle
that I am trying is to try to get the undergraduates to write most of
the justification (with LOTS of support), so that when the add-on
comes in, they feel like they did it.  This sense of accomplishment is
a tremendous encouragement.
.eq
.LP
Some universities have mentoring programs where female and minority
graduate students write a research proposal with a faculty member (male
or female).  If selected for funding, the student receives RA support
for a year and the faculty member may get a small amount for expenses.
A female graduate student who participated in one of these programs had
some illuminating comments about it:
.bq
I have some ideas about this, having participated in it first hand.
It is far from perfect.  While money (support) is important to female
graduate students (indeed to all graduate students), the goals
of the mentor program can't be met by merely providing monetary support.
Once the award has been made, what IS the incentive to the mentor to do
anything beyond what he/she was going to do anyway?  A survey was
conducted near the end of the award period to check on progress; its
contents might have encouraged some action, but March was much to late to give
suggestions that could have made a difference.  I think sometimes mentors
don't realize special needs/weaknesses that female graduate students may have.
Or they focus on allowances for family needs and aren't aware of the
need to break the social barrier put up by the good ol' boy club.
(Male graduate students, by the way, are the worst offenders in the
good ol' boy club.  Do they get this from role models, or are they
selected by some process that also selects this trait?)

What might help?
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fII would have liked to have had a series of small group sessions
with women who had successfully completed PhD programs in
science.  In groups of 5-7 they could have helped me know
what to do to ``demand'' the mentoring I needed.  This would
have also provided the success stories and role models I needed
at that point.  As an award recipient, I would have been willing
to commit to participate after successful program completion.
This could have been part of the terms of the award.
.IP \(bu
\fIThe graduate school made the awards, and they were very good about
seeing that I got my money and fee waivers on time.  Beyond
that, however, I felt ignored for the year.  I had some
expectation of interest in my progress at the beginning, but
soon found out that there was no one really following that
or caring how things were going.
.IP \(bu
\fISimilar small group sessions for the mentors who have agreed to
participate in the program would have helped.  As most of the
mentors involved were men and certainly were not accustomed to
female graduate students, I think they would have welcomed some
guidance beyond the original ``write a three page proposal''
handout they were given.
.LP
.RE
.eq

One final way to get women involved in research activities is to hire
them to work on research projects as programmers or other non-research
personnel.  At UCI, the software engineering faculty have hired several 
graduating senior women who had excellent grades but who did not want to 
go to graduate school \(em instead they wanted to go out and get jobs.  
Each of these women went on to Ph.D. programs at top universities after 
2-3 years of programming for our research projects.  This leads naturally
to the next topic \(em reentry programs for women.
 

\fBReentry Programs\fR
.LP
Several women noted the importance of encouraging women to return to school.
As one female faculty member wrote:
.bq
One thing I would like to see is more encouragement for girls
who have ``dropped out'' of math and/or science at some point during
junior high or high school to return.  There is all this discussion of
girls dropping out early that unfortunately implies that they can
never return, and are lost to math, science and engineering forever.
This is extremely counterproductive.
.eq
A few college programs have targeted re-entering women.  For example,
one female industrial researcher describes such a program at Mills College:
.bq
There also used to be a Master's degree program at Mills College
which was a cross-disciplinary program in computer science and
another topic of the student's choosing.  There were a lot of
reentry women in that program, as well as some men.
(The undergraduate program at Mills is all female, and there
are quite a number of older women students).
I don't know what the current status of the Master's degree program is.
.eq

The best known program of this type is at the University of California,
Berkeley where the Computer Science Division runs a program to prepare women 
and underrepresented minorities for graduate study in computer science.  
The program was established in 1983, and its first students were enrolled
in Spring 1984.
The program mission is to increase the pool of competitive women and
minority candidates for university professorial and research positions
by enabling them to take undergraduate technical and math courses required
for graduate work in computer science.  Additionally, the program provides
faculty advising, access to other Berkeley faculty and graduate students,
and support services such as tutoring, study groups, discussion groups,
technical and career-oriented seminars, strategies for applying for graduate
programs and scholarships, and facilitation of discussion and exploration of 
topics related to the reentry experience.  Financial support of the program 
comes from the university and from the industrial community.

The program has been small but quite successful, with graduates at many 
major universities including MIT, Stanford, CMU, Illinois, Berkeley, Texas,
Wisconsin, UCLA, Michigan, NYU, Brown, Dartmouth, Rutgers, and the University 
of Washington.  Of the 36 students who have completed the Reentry Program and
applied to graduate school, 30 have been admitted with a total of 91
admission offers received.  Of the 27 who entered graduate programs, ten
have completed masters degrees: three at Berkeley, one at MIT, one from
the University of Massachusetts, three from Stanford, one from Santa Barbara,
and one from the Oregon Graduate Center.  Several students have advanced to
candidacy in Ph.D. programs.

Several women wrote to me to tell me of this program.  An 
industrial researcher described it as follows:
.bq
The students in the program take the regular Berkeley c.s. courses,
and compete with the standard students there.  One of the advantages of
the program is that it allows students with non-standard backgrounds
or with a degree in another subject an opportunity to do coursework
at a major university.  There is also a supportive environment to which
the students themselves, female grad students, and some interested faculty
especially contribute.  And, finally, there has been in the past
(and I assume the same is true today) some financial support.
.eq
Another female professor, who was a student at Berkeley, also described her 
impression of the program:
.bq
The women were bright, had often worked in industry
for several years, and had academic training in a field  other then CS.
And often a less employable field, like a BS in Math.  They took 5 quarters
of basic computer science, electrical engineering or math, whatever was
needed.  I.e., each person's curriculum was based on where her academic
holes were.  Most students worked half time on the outside (no support
was available), which made the program quite rigorous.  I believe that
most of the money was raised from industry, with the university contributing
some \(em but you should check that.

[...] I also have first hand knowledge of the success of the reentry program at
Berkeley.  (I am a recent graduate of Berkeley, not the reentry program,
but the graduate program).  It has provided several topnotch graduate
students here at [...] University.  And it addresses a segment of the 
population that would otherwise be locked out of a scientific 
career \(em women in a related but deadend or unemployable field who are 
years beyond college.  I would strongly suggest starting similar programs 
at other universities, particularly ones in the vicinity of large scientific 
or engineering employeers.  The program at Berkeley could use more RA-type 
funding.  Typically the reentry students must work halftime outside of school
to support themselves; that time could be put to better use taking classes.
.eq
.LP
When non-traditional programs of this sort are tried, it is important that
the system be flexible enough to accomodate the unusual educational
patterns.  For example, some students who have gone through the Berkeley
reentry program have had subsequent problems in getting NSF fellowships.
A female professor writes:
.bq
NSF will allow
up to n (n=?20 semester hours, 30? quarter hours) of courses past the
baccalaureate degree for students applying for the fellowship.  Although
the reentry program students are taking undergraduate courses (data
structures, intro programming, etc.), they are not registered for a degree;
thus if they take too many courses they are overqualified for the NSF 
fellowships.  This can happen at the same time that they have not yet taken 
quite enough to be strong candidates for graduate school.  It is a catch-22 
situation.  Berkeley will not allow them to be registered for an undergraduate
degree (which would get them off the hook, since NSF does not count courses
taken towards an undergraduate degree, even if the degree is not attained).
This is because then they would have to compete against the normal Berkeley
applicant pool, and they are not strong enough.  NSF is unwilling (unable?)
to grant special dispensation for the reentry program.  Although the
particular catch-22 I am describing catches very few people, if there are
to be more reentry programs like this (what is Berkeley's success rate?), it
should be fixed.
.eq

\fB\s+1Funding for Female Students and Faculty\fR\s-1

.LP
Although funding may be extramural or within the university, I
am separating this topic because of its importance and scope.  All reports
have shown that women are less likely to get support as graduate students.
Funding is also important at the undergraduate level.  

Designing funding programs can be tricky.  Sheila Widnall, in her AAAS 
presidential lecture, warns that providing scholarships to female 
graduate students may actually be harmful because it is likely to keep 
women out of RA-ships that get them involved in research with a faculty 
member.  On the other hand, two female graduate students
and a female industrial researcher sent a joint response to this assertion:
.bq
At this point in time, funding for graduate students is very tight.  A
number of graduate students go through graduate school on fellowships
all the way through because of the lack of funding.  The fellowship students
must still do research in order to write a dissertation; having a fellowship
does not change this.  In addition, having a fellowship allows the student
the luxury of picking the professor with whom she most wants to work,
regardless of the professor's funding situation.  Thus, we recommend that a
fellowship program for women should be established.

To add to this, I would suspect that a woman who is at all insecure would
find it very difficult to approach a professor and ask for funding.
Having a fellowship would allow her to at least avoid this obstacle.
.eq
A female industrial researcher notes:
.bq
I think funding is important, but should be tied to research.  I know that
[... University] makes some grants that require the recipient to find a 
research advisor to get the money.  So the faculty gets a ``free'' RA and 
the student is not so isolated as with Fellowships.
.eq
.LP
A second problem in designing funding programs is to avoid setting up programs
that are easily stigmatized (``she got it only because she is a woman''), 
although we should not let this concern paralyze us either.  One female
graduate student responded to these concerns: 
.bq
I think we do need to be careful not to encourage the separate but
equal route followed unsuccessfully by the civil rights movement.
.eq
.LP
One way to avoid the impression of second-class awards is to stress the 
competitiveness and importance of the award
as NSF has successfully done for the Visiting Professorships for Women program.
This program includes special letters to the Chancellor of the recipient's 
university from Erich Bloch along with press releases.  An NSF employee wrote:
.bq
The strength of the VPW program (as you note) has been in its not being
viewed as a ``second-class'' program.  You're absolutely correct in the
concerns regarding stigmatization; there have always been concerns
within NSF (and in the larger community as well) regarding ``losers''
programs.  On the other hand, I find your targetted suggestions for
undergrads, RAs and others eminently sensible.
.eq

Funding programs can be divided into those for students, post docs, beginning
faculty, and more senior faculty.  One female professor had a 
suggestion for funding that could apply at all levels:
.bq
I thought of one thing to suggest to NSF in terms of special programs
for women \(em equipment.  In particular in many places it is
a real problem to do work at night for security reasons, but it is a
necessity for professional reasons.  How about suggesting relatively
small grants so women can buy a terminal, workstation, printer so it
is possible to work at home when it is not possible to go into school?
Also, many women have family obligations that prohibit working at
school at night, even if security is not a real factor.
.eq

\fBStudent Funding\fR

Student funding programs can be implemented by individual universities or by
government agencies such as NSF.  Some of these types of programs were 
described in the section on research opportunities for students and include
summer research programs, research mentoring programs for undergraduates and
graduates, and various types of special funding programs.
A female professor wrote:
.bq
Another thing I'd like to see is more financial support for
undergraduate women majoring in math, science and engineering.  Many
schools have very high work-study and summer-job savings requirements
as part of their financial aid packages, but I think it is much harder
for women than for men to find suitable jobs to make the required
income.  And minorities are often unlikely to enjoy the assumed
financial contribution from home, since even poverty-level parents are
expected to pay a large percentage of their income.
.eq
For graduate students, regular fellowship programs can be implemented.  A
female professor reported:
.bq
Apparently a couple of years ago an NSF advisory panel
recommended that both CS and engineering institute a special NSF
graduate fellowships for women (because of the strikingly low
numbers of women in those fields compared with other sciences).
The NSF director agreed to the one in engineering, perhaps in
part because the directorate in engineering came up with 50% of
the funds.  (The rest of the funds come from the education part of
NSF, which is supposed to double the number of NSF graduate fellowships 
over the next five years.  Diverting some of the money to
special programs for women etc. diverts it from the others, obviously.)
I just spoke with [...] at NSF. [...]  He said that
the idea of special graduate fellowships for women in CS is not dead,
but neither is it anticipated that it will be funded soon.  
.eq
Other types of funding programs mentioned earlier for students are 
(1) programs that add to existing research grants to include female RAs as 
is now done for undergraduates and (2) programs to provide funding for 
special research mentoring.  Another potentially worthwhile program is 
to provide travel funds for female graduate students to attend conferences and
workshops.  An NSF employee commented:
.bq
There have been
arguments for providing small travel-only supplements for PhD
researchers who couldn't quite make it in the research grant
competitions, but it seems that there is a crystal-clear need for such
awards to women graduate students in areas of science and engineering
in which women are historically underrepresented.
.eq
.LP
Several female faculty members stressed the importance of this
type of travel in providing incentive to continue their studies and in
establishing networking activities that helped them throughout their careers.
I have found this type of experience especially stimulating for my students:
they get a chance to meet other researchers and students, they see that
everyone is pretty human and that the papers are not any better than they
could write, they establish contacts for the future, and they usually come back
eager to write a paper for the next such meeting.  Two female graduate
students wrote:
.bq
Just about our favorite proposal you had was having travel funds for
women graduate students to go to conferences.  Do this if at all possible!!!
It is extremely important
to meet the field for both getting jobs and for getting research funds
if one decides to enter academia.

From my own experience, my advisor has
been wonderful about sending me to lots of conferences and meetings.  As a
result, I have a number of people to contact when I start looking for an
academic position this fall and when I start looking for funding.  Finally,
I usually return from each conference with either a new idea for research
or a way to improve my existing talk or research.
.eq

\fBPost Docs\fR
.LP
Post docs have not been very common or needed in CS.  For the most part,
faculty jobs have been so plentiful that new Ph.D.s did not want or need 
to take such positions.  But the situation may now be changing.  One 
university researcher wrote:
.bq
It is clear that the academic market for CS graduates will continue to
get tighter and it seems likely that CS will move towards the model
used by most scientific fields where new Ph.D.'s do a postdoc before
accepting a tenure track job.  This transition won't be smooth and if
we aren't going to lose all the new women Ph.D.'s in CS to industry
(where they won't be quite as useful as role models) we need to establish
more postdoctoral programs and professorships for women.
.eq
.LP
A few programs exist such as the University of California President's 
Fellowship Program, which provides postdoctoral fellowships to minorities
and women for use at any of the University of California campuses, and
the American Association of University Women which provides eight postdoctoral
fellowships for women in all areas.  Although some of the latter fellowships
are earmarked for minorities or women in particular areas (i.e., not CS),
four are open to women in any area.  

If the current trends in employment continue, new postdoctoral programs for
women in CS will be needed.  One female professor commented:
.bq
Post-docs for women at top
Universities would be an excellent way to help new Ph.D.'s get into the
mainstream.  These post-docs could be given as an add-on to an existing
grant \(em PI's who are interested could submit descriptions of their research,
which could be distributed and then women could contact the PI.  Then the
PI and the candidate could submit a joint proposal.
This would motivate PI's by giving them an extra person for their group,
and effectively a bigger grant.  And the woman would get exposure to
a first class research department.
.eq
.LP
Another female professor described an unusual use of a postdoctoral 
opportunity:
.bq
A year ago I received an NSF Postdoc in Math.  (I do theory.)  It was
an odd time to do it (five years out), but good for me, because I have young
children.  It's two years of full-time support, or four years of half-time,
generally supplemented by half-time teaching, or any combination thereof.
As one of my senior colleagues commented, the teaching will always be there.
The theorems might not be.  I'm not sure exactly what I am suggesting here,
but juggling kids, beginning a research program, tenure is crazy.  Despite
whatever sharing goes on, women are still the ones that get pregnant.
Some early career fellowships might be nice.  How to construct them so
that they don't backfire is not so clear.
.eq



\fBJunior Faculty\fR
.LP
The current NSF Research Opportunities for Women program funds women who have
not previously had NSF research support.  There are rumors that this program
may be phased out.  One female graduate student commented on this:
.bq
Do not phase out the Research Opportunities for Women program.  Getting
NSF and NIH grants is very difficult.  This could make a difference in
keeping women in academia.  Getting one of these grants certainly does not
preclude getting grants from other sources, but instead ensures that you have
some money to work with.
.eq
Two female graduate students also commented:
.bq
A final suggestion we would like to add would be to start a grant program
specifically for new women professors.  Not everyone can get a PYI.
Getting research funds is one of the keys to being a successful professor.
Knowing that there are some funds set aside to get started with might make
the difference for a young woman deciding to go into academia or not.
If we are trying to increase the number of women professors,
attention should be paid to new Ph.D.'s.

From my point of view, if I knew that there were some funds
set aside for new women professors, that would make ALL the
difference in my job decision.   I would definitely accept an academic
position if one were offered.  With the current situation, though, industry
is appearing a lot more attractive than it used to.
.eq

A female professor had an idea for augmenting the effectiveness 
of startup research funds:
.bq
[It is] best if these could be augmented by
mentors who would help with finding appropriate funding sources,
including contacts, and initial proposals.
.eq

Another way to help junior faculty is to provide them with release time from
obligations other than research.  UCI has a program called Career Development
Awards.  These awards are based on a submitted proposal.  If selected, the
recipient is given time ranging from a quarter to a year to devote solely
to research activities.  The program is open to all junior faculty members,
but females and minorities are given high priority in the selection process.  
This type of program can be implemented at a relatively low cost by a
university.

A female professor wrote:
.bq
The most valuable time for career building to new Ph.D.s is the years which
immediately follow the receipt of the degree.  That is the time for building
upon one's dissertation research, expanding research interests, networking
to establish valuable contacts with colleagues, etc.  Yet for most women,
those are also the years when one has the best opportunity \(em and sometimes
the only opportunity \(em to have children.... I suggest the type of awards
that are often targeted toward new Ph.D.s, such as those that are only
available within a certain time frame (e.g., five years) after receipt of 
degree, are often of little use to women, whose careers do not always follow
the same track as those of their male counterparts.
.eq

Often women find themselves in non-tenure track research positions and face
an additional stumbling block.  A female university researcher reported:
.bq
As in other fields, many female computer scientists (including myself)
find themselves in non-faculty positions within the university and, therefore,
ineligible for many NSF programs. In some cases, NSF could fix this problem
simply by changing its eligibility criteria. In others, it is a restriction
made by the university \(em for example, [...] does not allow research
associates to act as Principal Investigator on proposals to NSF or other
agencies.
.eq

But before women can apply for most grants, they need to get into faculty
and research positions.  A female professor commented on the importance of
getting women into faculty positions:
.bq
I think the best thing that can be done to increase the number of women
who are making significant contributions to science is to encourage the
best universities in the country to hire new female PhDs  as tenure-track
faculty. In these universities it is EXPECTED that faculty will produce
papers, write grant proposals, attend and give presentations at top
conferences, supervise PhD thesis students and so forth. When I graduated
with a PhD in mathematics in 1971, it was not possible for any woman in
science to obtain a position in such a university. I have been fortunate
to be in a university which has changed and improved, so that although the
math department of [...] in 1971 could not be so characterized,
the computer science college in 1989 can be so characterized.  It is very
important to get in an atmosphere where research is PUSHED.  If it is just
``allowed'' it will be too difficult to do well.
.eq

A more recent graduate wrote:
.bq
I graduated [in CS] with a Ph.D. last year and this is the first
time in my career that I've felt that I needed help from a ``women's
program.'' Right now I wish that there were more programs to help women
get started on an academic career.  I've been having trouble finding an
academic job, at least in finding the perfect job.  Much of my problem
is a reflection of the increasing tightness in the CS academic market.
Another part of it is the peculiarity of my area.
.eq

This is not an easy problem to fix, but one thing that might help would be
to establish chairs for female professors.  I know of such a chair for
women at MIT and also a new one, funded by the Clare Boothe Luce Foundation,
at Georgetown University.  There are probably others.  Alumni associations, 
private companies and charitable foundations might be willing to provide 
the funding for such positions.  Rotating chairs might be used to get
junior women into faculty positions and also to advance women to the upper
ranks.


\fBAdvancing to the Upper Ranks\fR
.LP
A previous section of this report presented the argument that emphasis should
be put on the early years to encourage entry into scientific careers.  There 
was also a great deal of support in my informal survey for placing the 
primary emphasis on the other end of the pipeline.  These respondents all 
tended to be women in academic or university
research positions or those who were planning to go into such positions.
Despite the obvious self-interest involved, the statistics do seem to support
the need.  The fact that there are only 33 female full 
professors in CS and CE out of 158 departments and 74 associate 
professors indicates an extremely serious problem in getting women into
senior positions.  This is not a function of women not being in the
pipeline long enough \(em 10-12% of the Ph.D.s have been
awarded to women each year for the past 15 years, but only 8% of the 
associate professors and 2.7% of the full professors are women.

The following comment came from a female university researcher:
.bq
I have seen many studies showing that as women advance professionally
they fall increasingly behind their male peers. Although I support the efforts
of NSF, AAAI, and others to encourage entry into CS, I do feel that more
attention should be given to capitalizing on the achievements of those
women who have struggled partway up the ladder.
.eq
 
And from a female university researcher:
.bq
Where in the pipeline should we strive to help women?  We'd like to
help everybody, but we have finite resources.  I'm most concerned about
programs that cost money, not projects like graduate student lunches or
mentoring which require only time.

I'd argue that we should help women further along in the pipeline than
most of the programs that now exist.  If we can dramatically increase
the number of senior women in CS (and science and engineering in
general) I believe the shortage of women in the earlier stages of the
pipeline will disappear.  Everyone needs to see someone they admire
doing the things that they want to do.  Women in CS see only men in
those roles \(em it's no wonder they decide that CS isn't the area for
them.  By helping just one junior woman become a senior woman we ought
to be able to create a role model for hundreds of women in the early
stages of the pipeline.
.eq
 
Another female professor wrote:
.bq
[...] the highest priority should be to
help more women move from junior to senior positions.
.eq
 
And finally, a female professor commented:
.bq
I think that promoting women into senior positions 
(and making sure they get grant money) is one of the most effective
ways to combat the problem.  One of the reasons we all have had
more help from men than women during our careers is that the men
are able to provide more help from their more powerful positions!
.eq

.LP
As mentioned earlier, the NSF Visiting Professorships for Women program has
been very successful.  Unfortunately, it is limited in size.  Very few CS
women have received these awards.  The program might be expanded, perhaps with
this type of program within each directorate.  One female faculty member
also suggested that universities might support such programs:
.bq
These could be modelled on the NSF
Visiting Professorship for Women program (which cannot fund all of the
proposals it finds worthy). Several constraints to consider: area
should be close to that of some faculty member(s) so visitor is not
isolated; teaching responsibilities limited to seminar in area of
expertise; possibly schedule explicit activities with women. Note that
women from industrial research labs as well as professors at other
universities could be attracted. These should be clearly marked as
distinguished positions, and not viewed or used as low-status
temporary positions.
.eq

An NSF task force on programs for women has produced a draft recommendation 
with the stated purpose of increasing the number of senior women faculty in 
the sciences.  Under this program,  NSF would initiate 5-year Career 
Recognition Awards of 
approximately $50,000 per year.  Candidates would be nominated by their 
institutions.  It is hoped that a 5-year program of this type will produce 
500 full professors (these programs are for all the sciences).  Support among
the respondents to my initial draft report for this type of program 
was very positive.

\s+1\fBMiscellaneous Comments\fR\s-1

Some comments were received that suggested problems for which there do not 
seem to be easy and obvious fixes or programs.  One female industrial 
researcher thought that parental leave is an important issue:
.bq
I think that current parental leave policies, and the lack
thereof, are seriously hampering young female faculty.  (And indeed, I
think, are also hampering an important group of young male faculty).
.eq

The two-body problem was the focus of a comment from
a female faculty member:
.bq
Many women faculty are married to faculty, often a few years older.
I probably don't need to tell you what the consequences are.  Michigan had
one imaginative solution: the University has ``affirmative action'' money,
in which half of the two-body problem is funded for n years (n<=5, I believe),
then the department takes over.  One can see problems in this type of
solution; it seems better than no solution ...
.eq

Several people noted the lack of representation of women in the ``power
positions'' of the field.  It is interesting that several of these commenters
were men.  A male professor wrote:
.bq
I finally got around to your article in the CRBs Summer Issue of
Computing Research News. Aside from three NSF program directors
(and several staff associates here and there), the only names of
women that I found from a quick scan of the entire paper were
yours, and those of Mary Shaw and Grace Ostenso.  Perhaps we have
not given sufficient recognition even to those women who have
established themselves in Computing Science.
.eq
A female professor also commented on the CRB newsletter:
.bq
I'm delighted to see the headway you are making ... concerning the CRB
report, I found it most disturbing that they have no women on the 
editorial board, which is my impression from reading the first page of
the bulletin. They do have a woman on their committee, I believe Mary Shaw,
which is great, but another few would help the image problem of what happens
after women enter the field. [...]  Perhaps you can use this as an example of 
lack of on-going perspective about women that the CRB should have.
.eq

In all fairness to the CRB, they invited my original article that prompted
these comments, and several of their leaders are very concerned about the 
problems of women in CS research.  

If one examines the two major professional societies
in our field, the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, two different patterns
emerge.  The ACM appears to have a large amount of participation by women
in important positions.  For example, at least 6 out of the 25 current ACM 
Council members are women.  Women are also well represented among the elected
executive committees of the ACM special interest groups (SIGS).  Of the 31
SIGS, there are three women chairs (one position is vacant).  In addition,
of the nine ACM journals, two of the editors-in-chief are women (22%) as are 
approximately 12% of the editorial board members.

In contrast to the democratic structure of the ACM which stresses elections,
the IEEE Computer Society officers are, for the most part, selected by the
previous officers, i.e., an ``old boy's'' setup.  In general, the 
representation of women as chairs and members of the Technical Committees is
much lower than the equivalent ACM SIGS.  Out of the 10 IEEE CS journals,
none have a female editor-in-chief and approximately 7.5% of the editorial
board members are women.  IFIP, and especially the IFIP Working Groups, appears 
to be even worse than the IEEE Computer Society.

The problem of getting greater representation of women in situations where
there is not a democratic process working is a difficult one to solve.  One
senior female professor suggested:
.bq
I get more requests to serve on 
study panels, program committees, visiting committees, etc. than I 
can handle.  When you turn down such an invitation you usually have 
the opportunity to nominate an alternate.  A couple of years ago I 
realized that it's awfully easy to name the first two or three 
people who come to mind \(em who are likely to be men.  Now I make a 
conscious attempt to propose women, both in this situation and when 
the initial lists for various activities are drawn up.
.eq

One final comment came from a female industrial researcher:
.bq
It's clearly a tough problem and it starts early.  I don't have any
magic bullets.  But I've thought about one thing that NSF could
do directly.  Assuming that a woman makes it as far as an entry academic
job, the next step is to get research funding, do research, and get
tenure.  There seems to be a lot of evidence that women's writing styles
differ from men's, in particular women hedge more; they are less self
confident.  One question I've wondered about but don't know the answer
to is whether such style differences have any affect on women's chances
for successfully getting research proposals funded.  ... If they do 
(and maybe even if they don't \(em there are clearly lots of
factors at work here) then one thing NSF could do is to help to assure
that their reviewers react as little as possible to the tone of a
proposal and instead react to its contents.  I don't know if they can do
that with some instructions to reviewers.  They can do it when they have
review panel meetings.  Of course this same issue may affect women at
other stages in their careers (for example, essays that are written to
get into graduate school or to apply for fellowships, e.g., NSF).  Some
of this is hard for NSF to have any direct effect on, but they could
watch for this bias in fellowship applications as well.
.eq

.CE 1
\fBRECOMMENDATIONS FOR NSF\fR

The original purpose of this report was to generate ideas for NSF programs
to increase the number of women in computer science research.  For various
reasons, this report seems to have taken on a life of its own and grown 
beyond the original intention.  In this section, I return to the original
purpose.  It should be remembered, however, that NSF is not the only source
of funding for these types of programs.  Other possibilities include state
and local governments, charitable foundations, industry, universities, and
alumni associations.

Because girls are dropping out of science and math at an early age, it is
important that programs for pre-college women be established and supported.
Although the CISE directorate may not be directly involved in such programs,
it can provide support to those parts of NSF that are involved in early
education.  Programs are needed both to encourage girls' interest in science
and math and to improve computer science education.  Special summer and
after-school programs have proven particularly effective in the past.

One of the most effective ways to get more women into graduate programs
is to provide
them with opportunities to participate on research projects.  This can
start with high school summer projects and continue through 
undergraduate study.  Funding summer research jobs and female undergraduate
participation on research projects would be a highly effective use of 
resources.  These programs should allow and encourage women attending primarily 
teaching colleges to participate at research universities.

The most effective funding for graduate students is that which is tied to 
research.  Fellowship programs combining research support with mentoring 
activities are needed.  A graduate fellowship program for females in
computer science and computer engineering could help women devote more
time to their studies and keep them in school.  Also, reentry programs allow 
women to return to school 
and to prepare for Ph.D. programs; the success of this program at Berkeley
suggests that other programs of this type would be effective.
Finally, there should be some type of program to provide travel funds for 
female graduate students (and junior faculty) to attend conferences and 
workshops.

In general, women in faculty positions are not doing poorly in the regular 
grant process.  However, a program that provides flexibility would be useful.
For example, NSF grants do not usually provide money for release time from
teaching and administrative duties.  Such support for a woman with small
children might allow her to maintain a research career and momentum while
starting a family.  Also, a small equipment grant program to finance home
computing needs should be considered.  The small number 
of senior women in academic positions implies a need to help women advance 
to the upper ranks of their profession.  The new Career Recognition Awards 
are one way to accomplish this.  More opportunity for computer science and
computer engineering women to participate in the Visiting Professorships
for Women program might also be useful.

Mentoring and other activities undertaken by departments and individuals
such as inviting women speakers and holding regional or local workshops can
have a profound effect on the careers of undergraduate and graduate students 
and could benefit from small amounts of funding from NSF.  Because
individual needs and interests will differ, a program to fund such
activities should allow general proposals without strict guidelines.
After more experience with these types of programs is gained, it may be
possible for NSF to provide more directed types of programs.  A follow-up
report to this one that provided information and feedback on such efforts
would be very helpful in guiding and planning future activities.  Funding for
release time to plan and participate in such networking and mentoring 
activities would make it possible for already overburdened faculty to
initiate and provide such activities.

A female graduate student stated very eloquently the reason why these of
programs should be undertaken:
.bq
Science's ability to build on itself and positively influence society is
hindered by the exclusion of important sectors of the society.
A woman has the right to educate herself, to know first-hand the beauty 
of science, and to attempt to make a contribution to the body of knowledge
of her choice.
.eq
By not providing the opportunity for women to contribute to scientific
activity, everyone loses.

   \fBEngineering losing its luster among students\fR
        by Ronald Rosenberg

Massachusetts' seven leading engineering colleges are experiencing serious
declines in enrollment as more Bay State high school students turn to majors
with less stringent mathematics and science requirements.

The drop in students studying such disciplines as electrical, civil, 
mechanical,
and aeronautical engineering at the undergraduate level mirrors the national
trend and is prompting renewed concern of an impending shortage of critical
talent in the mid-1990s.

The National Science Foundation estimates that by 1996 there will be a 
shortfall
of 45,000 baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering and that by the year
2010, there will be 700,000 fewer baccalaureate degrees than necessary to fill
existing jobs.

These predictions come after the boom years of 1976 to 1985 when engineering,
particularly electrical and computer engineering and computer science, were the
hot fields.  Schools were flooded with applicants and classrooms overflowed.
College computer centers had waiting lines, women began entering the field,
laboratory equipment was in short supply and engineering departments scrambled
for facilities.

Today some engineering schools, such as the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, are thankful that the rush for engineering students is behind.
But all institutions worry that the boom is turning into a bust.

At the same time, record numbers of foreign-born students are entering at
the graduate level and aggressively pursuing teaching positions that were
once the province of American-born students.  At Northeastern University,
nine out of 10 applicants for 5 teaching jobs in the engineering department
are foreign-born. 

And with the expected decline in college-age population, the National Research
Council forecasts that such nontraditional sources of engineers as technicians
or other non-registered engineers, will be tapped.  This will result ``in a
dimunition of quality that could threaten the long-term international
competitiveness of the United States,'' according to the council.

Moreover, students who do decide to pursue an engineering degree are often
weak in mathematics and science, according to several deans of engineering.

``We are concerned that the preparation engineering students get in math and
science in the high school is just not as strong as it used to be,'' said
John Proakis, chairman of Northeastern University's electrical engineering
department.

``What we also see is that students are not as interested in working hard as
students of 10 years ago.  When I tell them they have to spend 10 hours of
outside preparation for three hours of class per week, I hear students say,
`Gee, that is too much time.'  At the same time, I see students coming from 
the Far East who are willing to work to achieve their goals, and that concerns
me.''

Northeastern is a bellweather for local engineering schools since many of its
students are from metropolitan Boston and the surrounding New England states.
Disenchantment with engineering shows up in all disciplines, most notably
electrical engineering, where 907 students are enrolled compared to 1,408 in
1985 \(em a 35.6 percent drop.

Still, Northeastern is not alone.  Other major schools experiencing shortages
are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Lowell,
Worcester Polytechnic, Boston University, Tufts University, and the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Several national studies bear out this regional trend.  National surveys
show that students prefer the less taxing curricula in business, teaching,
and the humanities -- areas that do not require extensive high school
mathematics and science courses.

``Teachers of mathematics and science need to instill in young people the
thrill and adventure associated with engineering, not smother them in a
blanket of complexity,'' said Edward Cohen, [...]

Cohen believes engineers should become more involved in improving math and
science education in elementary and secondary schools as well as encourage
students \(em particularly women and minorities, to pursue engineering careers.

[...]

What worries engineering school deans are the reasons that high school
students give for shunning engineering despite a relatively strong economy,
lots of jobs, and relatively good pay.

``Characteristically we have seen a sloshing back and forth between students
in engineering and science but this year for the first time I didn't see this
balance,'' said Richard B. Adler, associate head of the electrical engineering
and computer science department at MIT.

Most disconcerting to the major engineering schools are the student preferences
listed as part of the PSAT last October.  Nationally, 9.4 percent of students 
taking the test indicated an interest in engineering compared to 10.5 percent
in 1985.  In Massachusetts, 7.7 percent of the high school juniors (2,931
of the 38,071 students who took the test) said they were planning to pursue
an engineering career compared to 10 percent (4,284 of the 42,846 students)
in 1985.

In computer science, the picture is even bleaker.  Only 1.8 percent or 685
students expressed an interest in a software career, compared to 3.3 percent
or 1,413 students four years ago.  Nationally, fewer women are expected to
pursue degrees in mathematics and computer science, according to the National
Science Foundation, which estimates that only 9,600 will graduate compared to
22,400 women in 1986.

     \fBMore Women Shun Engineering as Other Careers Beckon\fR
      by Ronald Rosenberg, Boston Globe, Monday Mar. 13

After nearly a decade of significant increases, fewer women are pursuing
engineering and computer science careers, prompting concern in academia
and industry that there will be a shortage of high-tech talent in the 1990s.

``The rate of women entering engineering schools nationwide is dropping
slightly faster than men,'' said Betty M. Vetter, executive director of the
Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology in Washington.

Vetter notes there are several reasons besides the overall decline in
college-age population.  Like men, women see alternatives to engineering,
which is perceived today as less vibrant than five years ago.

``Women at this point have seen older sisters going into engineering who are
often achieving at a far higher level academically than their brothers,'' she
said.

``But out in the real world they wind up getting paid less, hit glass ceilings
in advancement, and quickly realize that engineering is still a macho field,
highly dominated by men, many of whom don't want women there in the first 
place.''

Another factor inhibiting American women are the attitudes of foreign male
students and faculty who dominate the graduate and teaching levels of most
engineering schools.  Often foreign males, particularly those from Asian
countries, don't see female students as colleagues because of their own
cultural upbringing.

``There are certain groups of students from certain countries who have never
seen a professional woman and when they see one as a teacher it is a big
shock and sometimes creates difficulties,'' said Richard Reis, associate dean
of engineering at Stanford University.

``Occasionally we have foreign-born teaching assistants who simply discount
women in a classroom.  They don't call on women and often see them as just 
less important.  Also, a woman professor may be challenged inappropriately
by foreign students who will question her credentials.''

Stanford is not alone in this problem, in part because the engineering
profession continues to be male dominated.  Negative attitudes remain,
even when women match or exceed men in math and science.

Overcoming these prejudices and social barriers on top of a difficult study
load has prompted women to question whether it is worth pursuing an engineering
degree.  Three years ago 17 percent of the nation's engineering students were
women.  Today they are about 15 percent, noted Vetter.

And yet women are viewed by academia and industry as a key to the 
future \(em to teach in colleges and universities and ultimately to provide 
role models to other women.

With fewer college-age students \(em particularly white males \(em there is a
push to attract women and minorities to engineering.  That means an emphasis
on boosting mathematics and science in primary and secondary schools.

``There has to be an enormous shift in the participation of women in 
engineering \(em a new phenomenon \(em to meet the future talent needs of the
area's high-technology industries,''  said Ray Stata, president of Analog
Devices Inc. of Norwood and chairman of the educational committee of the
Massachusetts High Technology Council.

to Enter Doctoral Programs in Computer Science\fR

Introduction
.PP
As  the  baby  boom  continues  to  decline,   the  pool  of
college-age  white males is expected to drop significantly in the
future.   The resulting vacancies in  the  scientific  community,
including   those  in  computer  science,   could  be  filled  by
increasing  numbers  of  women  and  other   minorities.   [Widn]
However,  the  number  of  women  earning  doctorates in computer
science is still smaller than it could be.   This is due in  part
to  the fact that women are less likely than men of equal ability
to apply to graduate school. [HS83]
.PP
In 1983,  17.1% of first year college men and 19.4% of first
year  college  women  majoring  in  science and engineering,  had
aspirations of obtaining a doctoral degree. [Table 1] Contrary to
these early expectations,  only  4.8%  of  the  women  completing
bachelor's   degrees  in  1979  went  on  to  earn  a  doctorate.
Approximately 56% more of the men went on  to  complete  a  Ph.D.
[Table 2]  Furthermore,  in 1985,  36.9 percent of the bachelor's
degrees in computer sciences were awarded to women.   In the same
year, only 28.7 percent of the master's degrees, and 10.6 percent
of the doctorates were earned by women.  [Table 3]  These figures
show  that   a lower percentage of women than men decide to enter
graduate school.  The difference in participation rates increases
significantly after the master's degree is achieved.
.PP
Research has been done on the reasons women  don't  complete
doctoral programs, but most of the attention has been directed at
the  factors causing women to drop out.   That subject is outside
of  the  scope  of  this  paper.    Also  not  included  are  the
considerable  gender-related factors that influence the choice of
computer science as a field of study.   In  this  paper,  I  will
specifically  identify some of the gender-related issues that may
discourage women from applying to and entering a Ph.D. program in
computer science.  The topics addressed will  include:  lack  of
confidence, lack of role models and mentors, family
considerations, unfriendly environments, self-image,
expectations, and value systems.

Graduate Study as an Option
.LP

\fIContinuing Students\fR
.PP
Entry  into  a Ph.D.  program is generally considered at two
different times in life.  The primary one is when a bachelor's or
master's degree program is near completion.    The  student  must
decide  whether  to  continue in the educational pipeline,  or to
whether to enter into the `real-world'.   For both men and  women
the  appeal  of  getting  out  of school and becoming financially
independent after years of study is strong.   A clear idea of the
resultant rewards may cause a student to consider a Ph.D. program
as  an  option.    The  student  also  needs  to  feel reasonably
confident  of  success,   if  the  idea  is  to  receive  serious
consideration.
.PP
Unfortunately,  female students actually suffer a decline in
self-esteem and academic  ambitions  during  the  college  years.
[Asti] [Widn] In addition,  women tend to attribute their success
to luck or  hard  work,  rather  than  talent.    They  may  also
recognize  the fact that a woman often needs to achieve more than
a man would in order to receive  equivalent  recognition.  [HS82]
[SaHa] In short,  by the end of her undergraduate career, a woman
may feel she lacks the ability to succeed in graduate school.
.PP
The destructive  effect  of  the  college  experience  on  a
woman's confidence can be overcome with steady encouragement from
a mentor.  [Widn] [Boli]  The mentor relationship is described in
the following passage.
.RS
.IP
In academe, the primary model for mentoring has been the
sometimes lifelong relationship that can develop between
an undergraduate or graduate student and  a  ``special''
professor.    Ideally,  the  professor  takes the novice
under his or her wing;  helps the person set  goals  and
standards  and develop skills;  protects the novice from
others in a way that allows room for risk  and  failure;
facilitates  the novice's successful entry into academic
and professional circles;  and ultimately passes on  his
or her work to the protege.  [HS83] p. 3.
.LP
.RE

.PP
Unfortunately, the scarcity of female professors in computer
science  means  that  there is a serious lack of same-sex mentors
for female students.  In 1983, only 8% of tenure-track professors
in computer science were women.   It  is  quite  possible  for  a
student  to  complete  an  undergraduate degree without meeting a
single female computer science  professor.    Females  in  senior
positions are scarce indeed. [Table 4]  This situation can lead a
female  student  to  the  conclusion  that if the brightest women
can't make it to the top, then she certainly has no chance.

\fIReturning Students\fR
.PP
The second time graduate study is considered  is  when  some
change  in  lifestyle  is  desired.    This  may be due to job or
personal dissatisfaction.   It may be because  of  a  desire  for
emotional  and  intellectual  growth.  [Boli]  For a woman,  this
desire for change often  occurs  when  her  children  become  old
enough  to leave with a baby-sitter or go to school.   A woman in
this  position  may  have  the  advantage  of  spousal  financial
support.  However,  if she has been a housewife for any length of
time,  she may lack the self-confidence and courage necessary  to
apply  to  a  Ph.D.  program.    Some  women  decide to ease into
graduate school slowly,  on a part time basis.   In this way they
test their qualifications,  talent,  and ability to cope with the
increased demands.  [Boli]  However,  many  Universities  require
Ph.D.  students  to carry a full load,  thus depriving women this
chance to test their wings.
.PP
A woman with a family must also face the considerable burden
of trying to balance family and school  in  an  environment  that
demands  single-minded  attention.   [Scot]    This  attitude  is
described in the following passage written by  a  female  student
trying to combine marriage, a family, and graduate school.
.RS
.IP
Most  graduate  programs assume that their students come
relatively unfettered.   The student's time  belongs  to
the  graduate  institution,   and,   like  male  faculty
members,  graduate students come either single  or  with
wives  who  will  take  care of ``real  life''  for  the
duration.     When  a  married   woman   with   children
(especially young children) appears in this milieu there
is  consternation.    A faculty member might suggest the
woman wait until the children  are  older.    One  woman
faculty  member  has  refused  to  accept  advisees with
preschool children.    Another  invariably  recites  the
divorce  statistics.    The most unnerving aspect of all
this is the underlying assumptions about woman's  career
options and, ultimately, their seriousness in pursuing a
Ph.D.  [Levs] pp. 100-101
.LP
.RE

.PP
A  person  returning  to  school after working often faces a
great, often impossible,  loss of income.   While this is true of
both men and women,  women more often are self-supporting. [NS88]
If the woman has children,  her child-care expenses may not  even
be  covered  by  the  usually  meager support offered to graduate
students. [Levs]

.SH
Motivations for Graduate Study

\fIThe Academic Environment\fR
.PP
For some students,  the desire to enter into graduate  study
stems from a love of the academic environment.   For others,  the
acquisition of knowledge is a joy unto itself.  Still others find
the thought of regular  work  distasteful.    These  reasons  for
pursuing  graduate  study  should apply equally to men and women.
However some women,  especially those in non-traditional  fields,
are implicitly or explicitly made unwelcome.  [HS82]  The college
experience may even include sexual harassment. [SaHa]  Instead of
being socialized into academe,  a female  student  may  learn  to
think of school as an uncomfortable place.

\fICareer Requirements\fR
.PP
Another  important motivation for earning a doctorate is the
desire for career enhancement.  Some careers even require a Ph.D.
The most well-recognized of these  is  teaching  at  the  college
level,  but  there  are others.   For example,  an executive in a
technical field may view a Ph.D.  as assisting his climb  up  the
corporate ladder.   Unfortunately,  there are few female managers
in a position to take advantage of such an investment.
.PP
However,  women who want to do advanced research in industry
nearly  always  need a doctoral degree.   Although many women are
choosing careers in science and engineering,  there seems to be a
lack of women wanting to do advanced research.  Why is this?  One
reason  may  be the that the stereotype of the research scientist
conflicts with many women's self-perceptions.    A  scientist  is
seen as devoting most of his time and energy working alone on his
research.  He is seen as having little time for outside interests
or family.   Women,  consciously or not,  realize that this model
conflicts with their self-image as people  and  family  oriented.
[Eccl]    There  are  few  visible  women  scientists  around  to
counteract this stereotype.
.PP
Some  of  the  same  stereotypical  qualities  of   research
scientists  also  pertain  to college professors.   These careers
often overlap.   Although  teaching  is  a  traditionally  female
career,  women  soon  find that the emphasis on research at Ph.D.
granting institutions  overshadows  the  teaching  and  nurturing
aspects of the job.
Most   people   have   little   knowledge  of  the  academic
environment  before   going   to   college.      Therefore,   the
undergraduate  experience  is a significant factor in identifying
the possibility of an academic career.   A student's exposure  to
faculty may give her the idea that professors spend most of their
time  struggling  to  publish  papers,  get  grants,  and achieve
tenure.   The  impression  is  that  academe  is  a  competitive,
aggressive,  stressful and time-consuming environment, especially
for junior staff members trying to get tenure.   This is  a  very
unappealing picture for many women. [KiSE]
.PP
The  presence  of  a departmental role model may provide the
``existence theorem'' that a woman can be a  successful  professor.
[Dres]   Ideally,  such a role model would be a senior department
member and exemplify the ideal way to balance career and  family.
Unfortunately, such role models are few and far between.

\fIExpectations\fR
.PP
Many   people   decide  on  graduate  study  simply  because
significant people in  their  lives  think  they  should.  [King]
These  expectations  are usually internalized so that the student
expects to earn a Ph.D.   Parents can have an  especially  strong
impact on the aspirations of a child.   For men,  expectations of
job and academic accomplishments are usually  high.    Sometimes,
they are unreasonably high.   Women,  however,  still receive the
message that they should set moderate career goals.   Emphasis is
often  placed  on  raising  children and maintaining a happy home
life.   Thus,  a woman  may  choose  lower  career  and  academic
aspirations, reflecting society's expectations as a whole.
.PP
A   spouse   can  have  a  significant  effect  on  a  woman
considering graduate school.   A  supportive  spouse  will  often
assume  some  of the financial and familial responsibilities,  in
addition to offering moral support.  However,  jealousy can arise
if  a  wife's  achievements  threaten  to  overtake her husband's
credits.   A husband may also resent the time and energy spent at
school.  A woman who is unsure of her (possibly future) husband's
support may hesitate about taking a step which will be disastrous
on her home life.

.SH
The Value of Achievement
.PP
Jacquelynne S. Eccles has recently suggested a new model for
studying  the academic and occupational choices of women.  [Eccl]
She feels that women have been socialized to have different goals
from men.  Therefore, the value a woman places on the achievement
of a task is different than the value a man might  place  on  the
same  task.    She  feels  that  ignoring this fact has lead to a
negative bias when evaluating feminine choices.

.RS
.IP
Too often scientists adopt  a  male  standard  of  ideal
achievement   when   judging   the   value   of   female
accomplishments;  they seek to understand why  women  do
not  ``achieve''  like  men  without  considering that not
engaging in some activity may reflect the choice  of  an
alternate activity rather than avoidance....

As a consequence, very little systematic information has
been   gathered   regarding   the  more  typical  female
achievement    domains,    such    as    the    academic
accomplishments  of one's offspring and/or one's pupils,
the   satisfaction   of   one's   clients,    or   one's
contributions  to local organizations.   And until quite
recently,   even  less  information  has  been  gathered
regarding  the  meaning  women and men attach to various
achievement-related activities.   As a result,  we  know
very   little  about  why  women  think  they  make  the
achievement-related choices they do.  [Eccl] pp. 135-137.
.LP
.RE

.PP
It is easy to  see  how  a  woman  facing  the  decision  of
entering  a doctoral program may feel ambivalent.   Not only does
she have to weigh the benefits vs.  opportunity costs of graduate
study.   She must also compromise between her academic and career
goals and her more traditional female roles of mother  and  wife.
For most women, all of these goals are important. [Boli]
.PP
Furthermore,  to  be  successful  in  the traditionally male
areas of academic and  professional  achievement,  a  woman  must
often  appear  to  embrace  the  dictum that professional success
requires the sacrifice of all else.  [Eccl]  To admit that she is
not single-minded in her pursuit of ``success'' would mean inviting
criticism from many men.   If women's achievements are ever going
to be fully recognized,  then the definition of success is  going
to have to be changed.

.SH
Summary
.PP
For  women,  the  decision  to  enter  a doctoral program in
computer science is affected by many gender-related issues.  Lack
of self-esteem and realistic role models can  cause  a  woman  to
overlook  graduate  study  as  an option.   She may feel that the
burden on her family, both in terms of finances and time,  is not
justified  by  the  rewards.    Also,  some  of  the  motivations
typically attributed to graduate students may be  diminished  for
women.  The academic experience may have been uncomfortable, even
to the point of harassment.  The types of careers which require a
Ph.D.,  such as advanced research and college-level teaching, may
be perceived  as  having  qualities  which  conflict  with  basic
psychological  needs  and self-concepts.   Although some of these
issues are relevant to graduate study in general,  some are  only
evident when the field of study is a traditionally male-dominated
one.
.PP
In  order  to judge the decisions and achievements of women,
it is necessary to recognize  that  they  may  have  a  different
definition of success than men.  A woman may place a higher value
on   marriage,   family,   and  outside  achievements,   than  on
professional or academic success.   Whether a  woman  chooses  to
concentrate  all  her  energies  on her career,  or to give other
areas  of  her  life  equal  time,  her  achievements  should  be
recognized as equally valid.
