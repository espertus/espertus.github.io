            <p align="left">What did you wear?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I wore a PVC corset with a printed-circuit board pattern and a
              black slit skirt, which allowed me to holster a slide rule to my
              leg.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>You strapped a <em>slide rule</em> to your leg?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Not just any slide rule. It was my Dad's when he went to MIT.
              He passed it down to me. I was inspired by <a href="http://www.impawards.com/2000/posters/miss_congeniality.jpg">Sandra
              Bullock's look</a> in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212346">Miss
              Congeniality</a>, where she had a gun holstered to her exposed
              thigh.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Do you know how to use the slide rule?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I can do some operations, but I still haven't figured out how
              to program it.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Did you make the corset?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>No. I can make a printed-circuit board but don't know how to
              sew. I bought it from <a href="http://www.galleryserpentine.com.au">Gallery
              Serpentine</a> in Australia.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Where can I buy sexy geek clothes in the United States?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>My favorite online store is <a href="http://sexygoth.com">sexygoth.com</a> [now defunct].
              You can also search general auction sites for "cybergoth"

          <li>
            <p>How do you define "geek"?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Geeks are intelligent, enthusiastic people full of curiosity
              and passion.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Yeah, but would you want to marry one?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I am married to one. (So is my husband.)</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>How can you be a geek if you're in a relationship?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I don't equate geek with anti-social loser. Being good with
              technology doesn't imply being inept at everything else. Technical
              skill is not necessarily inversely correlated with social skill.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Wouldn't geeks rather interact with computers than with people?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Not this geek, and not any geek whom I have known (by
              definition). If geeks didn't want to communicate with each other,
              they wouldn't have created the Internet.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Yeah, but do you really want to be called a <em>geek</em>?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I'll admit I'm more comfortable with the term "nerd".
              I think there's a coastal difference in connotations. On the East
              Coast (where I went to school), <em>nerd</em> was positive and <em>geek</em>
              was negative. On the West Coast (where I now live), the reverse
              seems to be the case. I would be interested to know at what point
              in the country the shift takes place.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>On the East Coast, <em>nerd</em> is positive?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Well, at MIT we had the Nerd Pride movement. It was
              deliberately modeled after the Gay Pride movement, where a
              once-derogatory term was reclaimed.</p>
            </blockquote>
	  </li><li><p>Do you want my opinion on "nerd" vs. "geek"?</p>
	      <blockquote><p>Yes, I do.  I created a <a href="http://www.free-cgi.com/freecgi/poll/poll.asp?user=espertus">poll</a>.</p></blockquote>
	  
          </li><li><p>What are some of your geek credentials?

            </p><ul>
              <li>I'm MIT^3 in CS (Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD).
              </li><li>I wrote <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v46/i50/50b00601.htm">software
                to automatically detect "flames"</a> (insulting

          </li><li>
            <p>What sorts of things do you make your students do?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>I make them <a href="http://www.mills.edu/ACAD_INFO/MCS/CS/F00MCS111/lab5-solutions.doc">build
              computers from scratch (NAND gates)</a> and <a href="http://www.spertus.com/ellen/dilbert.gif">program

            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>You probably tell a lot of nerdy jokes, right?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Yes. For example, why do programmers confuse Christmas with
              Halloween?<br>
              Because 31 OCT = 25 DEC.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li><li>
            <p>Huh?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"OCT" means octal (base 8); "DEC" means
              decimal (base 10).</p>
            </blockquote>
	  </li><li>
	    <p>That didn't help.</p>

              <ol>
	      <li> "How many computers are in your home, and are they networked together?"
	      <blockquote>Other
contestants answered "one" or "two". I answered that I didn't know,
because there are processors in so many places in my house, such as in
my bread machine and in my electric car, which is able tocommunicate with my Palm Pilot.  </blockquote>

	      </li><li> "What is an achievement that you are proud of?"
	      <blockquote>I described my <a href="http://people.mills.edu/spertus/Kozmo/kozmo.html">successful anti-spam lawsuit against Kozmo.com</a>.  I am also proud of playing a <a href="http://archive.aclu.org/court/spr.html">small part</a> in <a href="http://archive.aclu.org/issues/cyber/trial/appeal.html">ACLU v. Reno</a> and been a board member for <a href="http://www.cpsr.org">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</a>.</blockquote>

	      </li><li> "What effect do you think open source will have on capitalistic institutions?"
	      <blockquote>I stated that open source completely challenges capitalism.  In <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>,
Adam Smith made the assumption (true at the time) that corporations
were geographically bound and that capital and labor could not easily
move. Those assumptions just don't hold anymore, particularly with the
Internet. As Eric Raymond stated in <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>,
who would have imagined, even five years ago, that a world-class
operating system could coalesce as if by magic from work done by
thousands of people around the world? Linux is one of the best
operating systems ever (certainly better than any Microsoft operating
system) and heralds the start of a post-capitalist era.</blockquote>
</li></ol>

        </li><li><p>What did you do for the talent round?</p>
	    <p></p><blockquote>I showed a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6547403189433277376&amp;q=spertus">5-minute video</a> that I made.  Highlights were:
	    <ul>
	    <li> <a href="http://stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a>'s endorsement
	    </li><li>
My argument that I was the sexiest candidate because I had reproduced
the most geeks, followed by a slide show of dozens of my students (and
their students) proudly displaying their projects. The background music
was Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" (not to be confused with
<a href="http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00103.html">Girls Just Wanna Defun</a>).
