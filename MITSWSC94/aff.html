<H1>1994 MIT SWSC Debate - Affirmative Position</H1>

<b>Resolved:</b> That to exploit advances in parallel processing technology,
Fortune 500 companies should invest in networks of distributed workstations
instead of parallel computers.<p>

See the <a href="pictures.html">illustrated summary of the debate</a> (slow to load, but worth it).<p>

In the first affirmative round, <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/"
>Dawson Engler</a> summarized empirical evidence showing:
<ul>
<li>MPPs are unreliable (KSR, Paragon, CM-5).  Their manufacturers (TMC, KSR) are also unreliable.
<li>Networks for distributed workstations are fast and getting faster.
<li>The University of Arizona successfuly put C* on a network of HP Snakes.
<li>MPPs don't have anything that workstations don't have, except for a huge price tag, more system adminstrators, and pretty lights.
</ul>
A more <a href="aff1.html">detailed summary</a> is available.<p>

In the second affirmative round (slides available in <a href="aff2.html">HTML</a> and <a href="aff2.ps">Postscript</a>), <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/analysts/ellens/">Ellen Spertus</a> emphasized the
following advantages of distributed workstations over MPPs:
<ul>
<li> cost (entry cost, price/performance, ability to use legacy
hardware);
<li> scalability (prototyping, expanding systems, meeting needs of
future applications);
<li> system availability (reliability, ability to be physically distributed
and to be linked to other types of computers); and
<li> software availability (applications and development tools).
</ul>
