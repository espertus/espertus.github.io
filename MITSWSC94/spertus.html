<h2>Multithreading</h2>
<ul>
<li> Allows processors to hide long, unpredictable latencies.
<li> Requires integrating incoming data with dependent computations.
<li> Can impair cache performance.
</ul>

[Multithreading impairs cache performance if threads are executed in a
random order, bashing your data locality.]

<hr>

<h2>Message-Driven Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li> Hardware queue buffers incoming messages.
<li> When processor idle, service message, performing dependent computations.
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Active Messages</h2>
<ul>
<li> Messages get serviced immediately.
<li> Handlers store data locally and decrement counters, possibly putting
computation in software-managed queue.
<li> Related computations are scheduled together, for better cache performance.
</ul>

[The operating system arranges computations so that ones using the same
data run in a row.]

<h2>Comparison</h2>

Message-Driven vs. <i>Active Messages</i><p>

<ul>
<li> Relies on buffers.<br>
<i>Does not use buffers.</i>
<li> Seeks control locality.<br>
<i>Seeks data locality.</i>
<li> Cooperative.<br>
<i>Preemptive.</i>
<li> Long message handlers.<br>
<i>Short message handlers.</i>
<li> Possibility of message queue overflow.<br>
<i>No possibility of queue overflow.</i>
</ul>


[Control/data locality: The message-driven approach branches (or falls through)
to the computation, lowering the instruction count, while Active Messages
works to improve cache performance.]<p>

[Message handler length: In the message-driven approach, computation is
performed in the handlers, while in Active Messages, computation is
scheduled by the OS.  A consequence of the longer messages in the
message-driven approach is that they can be better optimized (like larger
basic blocks), reducing the number of instructions and data accesses.]

<hr>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li> Implement both systems on the J-Machine.
<li> Measure dynamic instruction counts.
<li> Simulate cache performance, for various cache configurations.
<li> Determine total execution time for each system.
</ol>

[The message-driven approach has fewer instruction and data accesses.]

<h2>Results (miss = 12 cycles)</h2>

<img src="graph1.gif">
<p>

The graph shows the geometric mean of 6 benchmark programs.  Hits take 1
cycles, misses 12 cycles, and there are separate instruction and data
caches of the specified sizes.<p>

The message-driven approach is better for all configurations, taking 78-90%
of the time.<p>

The reason the message-driven approach works so well with a direct-mapped
cache is that it does much better in the instruction cache, because it can
often fall through from receiving data to using it.<p>
<hr>

<h2>Results (miss = 24 cycles)</h2>

<img src="graph2.gif">
<p>

The message-driven approach is still better, although it's closer.<p>

The reason the message-driven approach generally does best at the extremes
is that there the number of accesses dominates.<p>

<hr>

<h2>Results (miss = 48 cycles)</h2>

<img src="graph3.gif">
<p>

When misses take 48 cycles, the results are mixed, with Active Messages
sometimes achieving better results, although the message-driven approach is
still best for direct-mapped caches.<p>

<hr>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<ul>
<li> Message-driven is better for small caches and large caches, where the
number of accesses dominates.
<li> Active messages is better for medium-sized set-associative caches
with high miss penalties.
<li> Active Messages is not always worth the overhead.
</ul>
