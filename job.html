<p>[I wrote this essay in spring 1997. &nbsp;I updated it in
February 2009,
making minor edits, some of which are shown in brackets; removing,
replacing, or fixing broken links; and adding an <a href="#Afterword">afterword</a>.]</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I can't believe that finishing my dissertation
will be nearly as challenging as applying for over a hundred academic
and research positions, spending seven weeks on the road, juggling
offers with different expiration dates, solving the two-body problem,
and negotiating a contract, which is how I've spent the spring of 1997.
This document is meant as advice for other graduate students based on
my experience and stories I've heard. I've made an effort to point to
and not duplicate information
available elsewhere. The best exhaustive site on the PhD experience is <a href="http://www.phds.org">Phds.org</a>.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of a job search is to find the best
possible
job. This can be divided into two components: determining what your
ideal job is and convincing others to give you that position. When I
began my search, I didn't know if I wanted to be at a research lab, a
research university, or a liberal arts college. I wasn't even sure
what academic department I was most interested in. My job search was
as much about finding out what I wanted as convincing others to hire
me.</p>
<p>This document will be most useful to female computer
scientists
whose partner is in computer science and also looking for a job,
although most of it should be relevant to any doctoral candidate
seeking a job. Parts of it will be relevant to search committee
chairs wishing to be hospitable to job-seekers.</p>
<h2>The Early Stages</h2>
<p>Your job search begins when you get to college.
Not only is that when you being to network, but it's also when you
begin to learn what it's like to be a professor. Networking is
covered in other documents, such as Phil Agre's <a href="http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds4-4/network.html">Networking
on the Network</a>. It's harder to find advice
about
how to determine what type of job you want. Because you spend so much
time in graduate school, it's easy to learn what life is like
for professors at research universities. I don't think you can
intelligently compare job categories unless you've also worked for at
least a summer in industry (probably as an undergraduate) and at a
research lab (probably as a graduate student). Unless you're certain
you don't want to teach, you should get teaching experience. This
will both help you determine whether you like teaching and make you a
stronger candidate for teaching positions.</p>
<p>Another way to find out about the trade-offs of different jobs
is
to observe the people around you. In your years at graduate school,
you'll see professors climbing the tenure ladder and ones who have
made it. Learn from them. I observed that junior faculty members
tended to get divorced, turn prematurely gray, or lecture classes
right up until they went into labor. I also watched the choices made
by students who graduated before me. Whatever the choice, you can
learn interesting things by asking the person how he or she came to it
and staying in touch so you can see how they feel after a few years.

work hell? Life in industrial research</a>.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>If you will be applying for many jobs, organization is
crucial. My
major organizational components were a spreadsheet for keeping
track of applications, a word processor with support for address
labels, a wall map for keeping track of geography, and a filing
cabinet for application materials.</p>
<p>Whenever I found out about a position, I created a new row in
a
<b>spreadsheet</b>. [I used Microsoft Excel. &nbsp;I'd
advise someone nowadays to use an online spreadsheet, such as <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>.]
&nbsp;The column headings included the school's name,
city, state, number of positions, deadlines, the job listing URL, the
department's URL, required application materials, whether letters were
supposed to be sent directly, and the status of my and Keith's
applications, including when we applied, what we sent, and when we
received an acknowledgment. (Additional columns will be described
later.) This allowed me to easily view, for example, all employers
with deadlines of January 1 to which I had not yet applied or all
schools that I'd applied to but had not yet received an acknowledgment
from. The spreadsheet contained all the schools that either Keith or
I applied to, so we were able to share the file. We also shared it
with other graduate students. In a two-body job search, efficiency
can be greatly increased by having each person work on what he or she
is best at or prefers. For example, I did most of the typing, and Keith
did most of the photocopying.</p>
<p>The <b>word processor</b> I used supported
address labels, allowing
me to type an address once and use it many times: on my letter, on
Keith's letter, on our mailing labels, on mailing labels for our
references, etc. Even when it's more work, you should cut and paste
an address instead of retyping it, to avoid introducing typographical
errors. You should create a default cover letter and then personalize
it <i>carefully</i> for every application. I sent out at
least one
letter expressing my interest in "the Department of
&lt;&lt;FILL
IN &gt;&gt;". You should save an online copy of every letter
you
send out, in case you need to resend or review it. </p>
<p>In order to keep track of geographical constraints, I bought
and
posted a road <b>map</b> of the United States and southern
Canada,
putting different colored map pins wherever we were applying. When
one of us received an invitation to interview, I replaced the pin with
a thumbtack so it was easy to see the status of our job search
visually. The map also helped in planning the order of visits. Also
useful was the web service <a href="http://www.indo.com/distance/">How
far is it?</a>.
</p>
<p>I was able to fit all of my job search in one hanging
<b>folder</b>, which held a regular manila folder for
copies of each component
of my application packet, i.e., my CV, teaching statement, research
statement, transcripts, and reprints of various papers. Other things
to keep on file are stationery and envelopes, which you'll run through
much faster than you expect. When you make copies of some component,
like your CV, I advise you to make many. Keeping the folders full
makes the marginal cost of an application small: just grab something
from each folder and pop it in an envelope. You will invariably waste
paper when you have to update material, but I don't think this can't
be helped. <a href="http://www.arborday.org/">Plant a tree</a>
when
you graduate. Don't try to economize by using both sides of a piece of
paper. I sent double-sided CVs to a few places I applied, and, at two
places I visited, I discovered that people I met with had only half my
CV, since only one side had been copied. For this reason, you should
also number your pages. &nbsp;[Nowadays, many, but not all, schools
accept online applications. &nbsp; One reason some schools require
paper applications is because fewer people apply, due to the effort,
saving the search committee time by eliminating less interest
applicants.]</p>
<h3>Determining Where to Apply</h3>
<p>I followed my advisor's advice and applied anywhere that I
thought
it was even remotely possible that I would be interested. She told me
that she sometimes hadn't realized how attractive a place was until
after she reluctantly accepted their invitation to interview. Another
professor advised me to instead select no more than ten places that I
was most interested in and to really focus on those. I combined the
approaches by applying everywhere <i>and</i> putting in
extra effort
to the likeliest places. </p>
<p>You can find CS faculty ads posted at the <a href="http://www.cra.org/Jobs/">CRA</a>,
<a href="http://jobs.acm.org">ACM</a>,
and <a href="http://careers.computer.org">IEEE</a>
sites and in the corresponding print magazines. You can also get on
mailing lists, such as the <a href="http://www.cra.org/Jobs/">CRA
job list</a>.
There are sites
that charge for access to the newest job listings and provide older
ones for
free, such as&nbsp; <a href="http://www.chronicle.com">The
Chronicle
of Higher Education</a>.
I found a six-month subscription to the <i>Chronicle</i>
to be well
worth the cost ($40.50). Not only could I electronically search the
latest job listings, but I could easily research a school by searching
the archives and could access data about professors' salaries, etc.
If you're interested in teaching-oriented schools, in addition to
reading the <i>Chronicle</i>, you should also join <a href="http://www.sigcse.org">SIGCSE</a> to get
access to its
job mailing list, or find someone to forward you the messages. I
advocate sharing information with other graduate students. While it's
possible that the job you want won't be offered to you because you
told someone else about it and they applied, it's also possible that
the job you want will be available because someone turned it down to
accept a position you told them about. Besides, it's good karma.</p>
<p>One reason to eliminate jobs at this stage is a two-body
constraint
(a partner who is also seeking a job), unless you're willing to share
a position. Keith and I only applied to places that had multiple
positions or were near other employers. (Actually, before we were
engaged, I applied to a few places in the boondocks. When Keith
observed that there were no jobs for him nearby, I said that I didn't
know yet what his intentions were.)
He agreed to apply for jobs
that weren't at the top of his list, and I did the same, to maximize
the chances of finding a two-body solution. Neither of us played any
games with only applying to places high on our list to try to force
the other to make any sacrifices. If you don't want what's best for
both of you, you shouldn't be getting married.</p>
<p>Keith wanted to work at a research-intensive institution, so
he eliminated schools that didn't have PhD programs or had poorly-rated
research programs. The <a href="http://www.cra.org">Computing
Research Association</a> has a
very useful <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/nrcstudy2/rankcs.html">
tool for ranking PhD-granting CS departments</a> [although the
data is now very out-of-date]. I wanted to work with bright
students, whether or not they were graduate students, so I eliminated
schools that were rated as being less competitive, based on their
undergraduate admissions criteria. You can buy a college guide
(often at a used book store) to find out what tier a school is in, or
you can find the information online through <a href="http://www.usnews.com">U.S. News
and World
Report</a>. We added some of this information to our spreadsheet.
You might also want to look for schools in a certain category, such as
historically-black colleges and universities (HBCUs) or science-active
liberal arts colleges, and guides are available for these. The best
qualitative general guide to colleges I found was <i>The
Insider's
Guide to the Colleges</i> by the Yale Daily News staff. Take what
you
read in these books with a grain of salt, however. I read in <i>Lisa
Birnbach's
College Book</i> that Mills students wear "severe daytime
dress-up... and have the luster of a newly lacquered manicure."
Not when I visited. All of the students I saw were dressed casually,
and they had just constructed a giant mud ball. &nbsp;[Nowadays, I
would recommend the <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com">Princeton
Review website</a>.] </p>
<p>Some people apply to departments that haven't advertised
positions.
I didn't try doing this, although I did email some department heads at
interesting schools to ask if they anticipated any openings; I didn't
find any this way. When I applied to multiple departments at one
school, I wrote in each cover letter that I was applying to both and
would consider a joint position. </p>
<h2>The Application</h2>
<p>Ask for the job packets of successful job-seekers in order to
create first drafts. Then, have your advisor and any other friendly
professors suggest changes, which you should take very seriously. I
was able to get very useful advice from MIT professors on applying to
research universities. Since I was also interested in liberal arts
colleges for women, I put together a draft job packet well before any
were due and sent it for criticism to a friend who is a senior
professor at
such a school. I also found much useful information in Malcolm
Campbell's <a href="http://www.ascb.org/newsfiles/teaching.pdf">How
to Get
a Teaching Job at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution</a>. </p>
<p>Make every effort to send in an application by the requested
date.
While some schools accept late applications without complaint, there
are other schools that return or discard applications postmarked after
the deadline, as I learned the hard way. You can always update an
application by sending further information later. It is your
responsibility to make sure that letters of recommendation arrive,
especially if the position announcement says that you should arrange
for the letters to be sent (as opposed to their soliciting them if your
file seems interesting). You should find out from each reference
how he or she likes to receive requests: through an assistant, with
printed labels, with online labels in various formats, etc. You
should send requests for multiple places together, instead of
dribbling them in one at a time. Many places won't consider your
application until it is complete (i.e., all letters have arrived) and
don't tell you if it's incomplete. It is your responsibility to
contact the professor or administrator in charge of the search to find
out which letters have made it into your folder. Don't assume that
because a letter got sent that it arrived to the right place. Many
letters go astray and have to be resent.</p>
<p>Most schools will send you an acknowledgment within a few
weeks of
receiving your application or the deadline. If you do not get an
acknowledgment, email or telephone the contact person. (I did this
and discovered that something had indeed got lost along the way to one
school.) You
will also receive an affirmative action form from most places,
requesting information on your race, sex, and how you found out about
the position. (For this reason, you might want to include a column on
your spreadsheet indicating where you first found out about a job.)
Returning the forms is not required, and they are not part of your
application. They go not to the search committee but to the
affirmative action office, so they can document what type of people
applied for the job and that it was properly advertised. Don't assume
that if you're white that you're at a disadvantage. According to the
1996 <a href="http://www.cra.org/statistics/">Taulbee
Report</a>,
"a much larger percentage of white non-Hispanics are hired into
tenure-track positions than are awarded PhDs." Similarly, I have
seen little advantage for female candidates – and more personal
questions, which I'll get to in the section on interviewing.</p>
<p>For every position you care about, you should also find a
personal contact. <i>This is not optional</i>. If you know
a professor in the department, contact him or her and say that you're
applying for a position and that you're very interested in the
department. If you don't know somebody, ask your references, especially
your advisor, to put in a good word for you, or see if you can find
someone in a professional organization you belong to, such as <a href="http://www.noglstp.org/">NOGLSTP</a> or
<a href="http://anitaborg.org/initiatives/systers">Systers</a>.
I
cannot stress enough
how important a personal contact is. There was one school I was
interested in – let's call it Stateville – because I had heard good
things about it from a relative who had attended and because it was
located in an area I wanted to live. I was very highly-qualified for
the position and expected to be invited for an interview as soon as
they started the process. I wasn't. I later found out this was
because they thought I was out of their league, especially because
they'd heard I had been invited to a more prestigious
school in the area, which we'll call Joliet. I actually would have
preferred Stateville to the more
prestigious schools. By the time I found out what was going on from
someone I met at Joliet, had her communicate
my interest, and got an invitation, it was too late in the season for
me to seriously consider them. Avoid these situations by making use
of social networks early.</p>
<h2>Responding to Invitations</h2>
<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<p>Typically, a professor will call you (or ask you to call) to
extend
an invitation. A few financially-poorer schools wanted telephone
interviews first. It was at this point that Keith and I mentioned the
two-body problem, if there was no other employer in the area, although
some couples don't say anything until one receives an offer. A
couple that went through the process before me said that mentioning
their spouse at the invitation stage usually got the spouse an
invitation. That
wasn't the case for us. We got invited to interview at two of the
same schools, but that appears to have been coincidental. A few
liberal arts colleges asked if we would be interested in sharing a
position; we weren't. (While sharing positions helps some people
solve the two-body problem and to balance an academic career with an
outside life, my impression is that it's more than half-time work for
each person at only half pay.) When told about the partner, we were
sometimes told about job possibilities in the area and in one case
received the suggestion that the other person apply for a research
scientist position. Schools still encouraged us to fly out to
interview even after we pointed out that our two-body constraint
seemed unsolvable with them. Keith and I both had the experience of
being invited to a school that wasn't interested in the other person.
It might be hard psychologically if one partner is universally seen as
the stronger candidate. </p>
<p>Some places offered more than a month's notice and a choice of
interview dates; others said, "Be here by Wednesday or forget
it." People typically have their first interview be at a place
that's not their top choice, since they'll get better at interviewing
as the season progresses. In general, however, I'd recommend
interviewing at the places you're most interested in early in the
season, particularly if you have a two-body problem. Keith and I
timed things poorly, and I received an attractive Bay Area offer (with
a two-week deadline) a week before Keith's first Bay Area interview.
Another reason to schedule less attractive schools later is that you
can cancel them if you get a more attractive offer before visiting.
This is not rude. I've always been thanked when I've told a host that
because of an offer I've received that it no longer makes sense for me
to interview with them.</p>
<p>Because the invitations will arrive in a random order,
possibly
after you've started traveling, an optimal ordering is impossible. I
thought of it as an on-line (on-the-fly) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem">traveling
salesman
problem</a> or sometimes as a treasure hunt, where in each city
I'd
find out what the next city would be. While you can't do an optimal
scheduling, there are things you can do to make your scheduling
easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule slack into your schedule. Leave some space between
your
East Coast tour and your West Coast tour so you don't have to zigzag
if more invitations come in. (If none do, you get to go
home or take a vacation.)</li>
<li>Arrange for your weekends especially to be with you
romantic
partner if possible. Book yourself a room at a bed-and-breakfast.
One of you should be able to get reimbursement from whoever's
interviewing you that Friday or Monday, on the grounds that it kept
you from having to fly home.</li>
<li>If you can't be with your partner, stay with friends or
family. I
found staying in a house or apartment with people I like to be far
preferable to staying in a hotel room, however fancy.</li>
<li>Once you have an invitation, let other employers in the
geographic
area know that you'll be there. Sometimes a place will be willing to
interview you if someone else pays or shares the travel expenses.
Also, letting them know you have an invitation usually makes you more
desirable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most strenuous weeks I booked had me doing a two-day
interview
on Monday and Tuesday, resting on Wednesday, and interviewing at two
separate places on Thursday and Friday. Scheduling anything more
intense than this is not recommended. After two days on, you should
have a day off if at all possible. You can spend a rest day traveling
if it's a non-stop flight, but it won't be a restful day if you're
having to change planes and worry about connections. I'd recommend
scheduling no more than three days of interviews and one day of
traveling in a week. One two-day interview is less strenuous than two
one-day interviews, since (1) you'll only have to give one talk
(generally), (2) the second day is sometimes shorter, (3) you'll be
going back to a familiar place, and (4) you won't have to do any
traveling in between. You can make life easier for yourself by
requesting at least 15 minutes to your self immediately before your
talk for preparation (or just for resting your head on a desk).</p>
<p>If you have any special needs, now's the time to make
arrangements, such as those made by <a href="http://www.itcs.com/elawley/">Elizabeth Lane Lawley</a>,
who became
an assistant professor at Rochester Institute of Technology:</p>
<blockquote>I brought my (then 5-month-old) baby with me on
interviewing trips. I
was still breastfeeding, and was unwilling to
wean for the purpose of a job hunt. So I arranged for child care in
advance in each city, but also told the search chairs that I'd need
private time at lunch each day in order to express milk for him. I
figured that if they still offered me a job, I'd know they were
basically mother- and family-friendly. </blockquote>
<h3>Air Travel</h3>
<p>You should belong to the major frequent flier programs. To
consolidate your miles, find out which airlines are partners.
&nbsp;Some air travel tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online travel booking sites usually show&nbsp;you what
a flight's on-time rate is. </li>
<li>If you're changing planes, try not to be scheduled on the
last
flight of the day from the connection city to your destination.</li>
<li>Special meals are often better than the regular meals,
especially
for people with dietary restrictions. There's a high chance your
special request will get lost, so confirm with the airline at least 24
hours in advance.</li>
<li>If you're buying a full coach ticket (i.e., no advance
purchase),
you can often get assigned a seat in the exit row, giving you more leg
room.
You can request one at check-in with a regular ticket. Only do this
if you'd be strong enough to open the door.</li>
<li>When you check in, make sure your frequent flier number has
been
entered. It is a pain to try to get credit retroactively.</li>
<li>When you get your ticket, check it over immediately. I once
told
a travel agent I wanted to fly from Washington [State] to Dallas and
received a ticket from Washington D.C. to Dallas.</li>
<li>Bring a water bottle on the plane with you (even if you
have to buy or fill it after security) and drink a lot. If you finish
the bottle, you can take it to the galley and ask the flight attendants
to refill it for you.</li>
<li>If you get invited at the last minute, occasionally
business class
or first class will cost no more than the cheapest available coach
fare. It doesn't hurt to ask. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparing for Interviews</h2>
<p>The most strenuous part of the job search is traveling the
interview circuit. The more you prepare in advance, the less
stressful and more productive your trip will be. As I mentioned, I
was on the road for over seven weeks, making it back to my home base
(Seattle) for only two (separate) days during this time. You can get
advice elsewhere on how to prepare a talk,
what questions to expect, and so forth. You'll get the best job talk
advice from people at your own institution who attend your practice
talks. Be sure to include some people who aren't already familiar
with your work.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to prepare for interview travel is
<b>money</b>. You'll have to pay for dressy clothing,
accessories,
and travel expenses, such as airfare. You'll eventually get
reimbursed for most of the travel expenses, but it won't happen
overnight. I fronted over $3000. If you don't have the money, borrow
it. Some advisors have been willing to make bridge loans to
students.</p>
<p>You can save money on <b>clothing</b> by starting
to shop for it
well in advance, keeping an eye out for sales. Consider also checking
out consignment shops (high-quality used clothing stores). You should
have at least two dressy outfits,
because some interviews last two days. You will also need some
non-grubby comfortable clothes, because a faculty member may pick you
up at the airport and take you straight to dinner with other people
from the department. Make sure that your clothing is practical and
doesn't wrinkle too easily. Women: When you're tempted to buy a dress
or skirt that is knee-length or shorter, ask yourself whether you'll
feel comfortable in it sitting next to someone, climbing up stairs,
getting out of a car, etc. Also, make sure your shoes are
comfortable, because you will have to walk around campuses. I find
Easy Spirit to be a good brand of women's shoes. Wear your whole
interview outfit for the day of a practice talk. If your blouse is
see-through, you'll want to find that out before the real interview.
Remember that new invitations might come in while you're on the road.
I had only packed one outfit suitable to wear in warm locales but got
invited at the last minute for a two-day interview in Los Angeles and
had to improvise.</p>
<p>You will also need <b>luggage</b>, preferably a
garment bag if
you're bringing a suit. If you can't borrow one, use an opaque zip-up
vinyl bag, which you can buy where you bought your suit. I bought
some luggage with wheels and found that very helpful, although you
shouldn't fool yourself into thinking you'll never need to carry it.
Don't buy luggage at a posh store. You can get it much cheaper at a
discount store, such as Target, or through AAA. I got a three-piece set
of Samsonite
luggage for $129 and brought the tote bag and the wheeled carry-on
with me. While I sometimes checked the "carry-on",
particularly when it was overstuffed and couldn't fit in the overhead
bin, I was glad not to have a full-sized suitcase to lug. You often
have to walk quite a ways from the gate or baggage area to the rental
car. If you'll be making a number of trips, make life easier for
yourself by keeping a toiletry bag stocked. If you're
not sure whether to pack something, ask yourself how much it weighs
and how inconvenient it would be not to have it. For example, bring a
nail clipper, earplugs, and extra pantyhose. Don't necessarily bring
enough reading material to last you the whole circuit, because it's
easy and inexpensive to buy books and magazines as you travel. For
more information on traveling light, see the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/%7Etravelite/index.html">Travelite
FAQ</a>. I don't recommend traveling with a bare minimum,
however:
Bring things that will make you feel comfortable in unfamiliar
surroundings, such as a copy of your favorite tape (to play in rental
cars) or a
stuffed animal. Consider packing an empty duffle bag, in case you
accumulate more stuff as you travel, as I did. </p>
<p>Be sure to think about your <b>health needs</b>
when you pack.
I was glad that I brought Pepto-Bismol, which was good
for the nervous stomach I had before my first talk, and Source
Naturals Wellness Formula, an echinacea-based
tablet that I took when I felt particularly run-down to boost my immune
system (even if only by the placebo effect). If there are any
infections that you are particularly prone
to, you might want to bring treatment. In any case, bring information
on how to contact your doctor. If you catch a cold, medicine won't
help (except for the symptoms), but if your mucous turns green, you
can call your doctor for antibiotics, which will probably help.</p>
<p>You'll need <b>accessories</b> to go along with
your spiffy dress
clothes. All the briefcases I saw were very expensive (hundreds of
dollars), but I found a nice-looking fake leather portfolio for about
$15. I don't know if you can get away with a canvas bag from a
conference. I'd advise women not to lug purses. The dress I bought
was sufficiently low-cut that a scarf was a necessity, as were safety
pins, which I neglected to pack. Douglas Adams claims a traveler
should never be without a towel. I found a scarf even more
indispensable. I draped it over my arms to prevent sunburn when
taking a long walk on a Southern California campus, I knotted it over
my chest when I discovered that the front of a dress was flimsy, and I
used it as a belt to increase the formality of a waistless dress.</p>
<p>If you live alone, you'll have to make arrangements for <b>mail</b>
that arrives when you're gone. In the month before your trip, pay
twice the amount on your utility bills if you can afford to. For
example, if your phone bill is $30, send in a check for $60. That way
you can safely not pay the next bill. (I'm presuming that your
utility bills will tend to be lower when you're away.) Telephone any
mail-order clubs you're in and tell them to suspend your membership
until April 15. Arrange for a neighbor to pick up your mail and
forward anything important, or have it held at the post office. I
notified the post office that certain friends could pick up my mail.
One did after a few weeks and forwarded things that looked important.
I also had a friend watching my mailbox at school for job-related
material. Since you may not be able to get to your email very often,
you might want to have a friend check it for you. Keith checked my
email while I was traveling and faxed important things to where I was
staying. Make sure your office-mates have your cell phone number, and
tell them to give it to any callers. It is crucial that you remain
reachable during your job search.</p>
<p>The most useful <b>information</b> about each
place can usually be
found on the Web. Print or download the home page and the pages of all
the people
you expect to meet, and read them on the airplane. If you're in touch
with other job-seekers, you may be able to pick up gossip about places
they've been (or share gossip about where you've been). If you have
the chance, learn to pronounce any unusual names of people in the
department you think you're likely to meet. You can do this by asking
around (either someone who knows the person or knows the language the
name comes from) or by calling the person's office in the middle of
the night and listening to their voice mail message.</p>
<p>Other important information that you'll want to keep on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of your airline frequent flier numbers. </li>
<li>A copy of your slides in the source language (e.g.,
PowerPoint)
and in a printable format (e.g., Postscript). You should store these
on a flash drive that you bring with you and also place them in a
directory you
can download them from. &nbsp;You might also want to buy and bring
a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=kensington+wireless+presenter+with+laser+pointer&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">presentation
clicker with a laser pointer</a>. &nbsp;Make sure you've
practiced with any such tools before the real talk.</li>
<li>Your passport if you might cross the U.S.-Canada border.</li>
<li>Your driver's license, for rental cars. Make sure it hasn't
expired.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important preparation is probably <b>emotional</b>.
In
addition to figuring out what job you really want and not just what
you think will impress or please others, you also have to deal
with the fear of rejection. Many of us getting our PhDs have never
been significantly rejected academically or professionally. You will
get rejected on your job search. Most places you apply won't invite
you for an interview, and most of these places won't make you an
offer. Remember, if you never hear "no," you're not aiming
high enough. Don't be afraid to risk rejection, and, when it comes,
don't take it personally. Something that helped me keep perspective
was a 1996 rejection letter from a third-rate university to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Karp">Prof.
Richard Karp</a>, which was posted in the mailroom at University
of Washington. Karp has won a
National Medal of Science (1996) and the ACM Turing Award (1995), the
highest award in computer science. If even he gets rejected, I think
I can handle some rejection too.</p>
<h2>Interview Trips</h2>
<h3>Before the Interview</h3>
<p>When you arrive into town, usually through an airport, you
will
either be picked up by a faculty member, get a rental
car, or ride a taxi or shuttle to your hotel. Often, you'll have
dinner with your host the night before your interview. A few places
even have receptions for a candidate at a professor's house.
Attendance at these is greatest early in the season. These events can
be a little awkward, especially if graduate students are present, in
which case there will be two circles, one of faculty and one of
students, forcing you to socially choose between the two. I'd advise
spending at least half the time talking with faculty and at least ten
minutes with students. While talking to the students is easier than
talking with faculty, remember to behave professionally. This is a
good time to ask students what they like best about the department.
You can ask them more delicate questions the next day when the faculty
isn't in earshot. Similarly, don't ask faculty members any delicate
questions at a reception.</p>
<p>Most schools will put you up at a big hotel, although a few
use
inns or bed &amp; breakfasts. If you are traveling with
your partner and are not married, you will probably be asked if you
want one room or two. Resist the temptation to make a smart remark
and just answer the question ("one room will be fine" or
"we'd prefer two rooms"). One time, Keith and I were given
the choice of a hotel or a bed &amp; breakfast. We chose the
b&amp;b
and found it very pleasant. When we came home from a tiring day of
interviewing, our hostess prepared tea for us. Breakfast was less of
a production than at a hotel but at least as good, and we took the
opportunity to talk with our hostess and learn more about the region.
The disadvantages of b&amp;b's are that you might not have a phone
in
your room, you may have a shared bathroom, and there might not be
high-tech amenities like fax machines, Internet access, and voice mail.
Whether you're
at a hotel or b&amp;b, you can expect to be able to request an iron
and ironing board.</p>
<p>When you check into a hotel or rent a car, ask if
they grant frequent flier mileage. You may also want to ask at
check-in what's included. Usually, local calls are free or paid for
by your hosts. You may have to pay for long-distance calls yourself.
Room service is usually covered but not always, and there may be a
daily limit on what you can spend on food a day (which is only likely
to be a practical issue if your partner is accompanying you). I
don't know whether laundry or dry-cleaning are ever covered; I didn't
use them. It's simpler to buy fresh pantyhose and to wash underwear
in the sink with bar soap, letting it air dry overnight.</p>
<p>It's good to have lots of one-dollar bills with you at a
hotel,
since there are so many times tips are expected. When possible, such
as with meals at their restaurant or room service, include the tip on
the bill, so the school will pick it up. I never tried getting
reimbursed for tips not associated with a meal or taxi bill. You
should leave a tip of $1-2 per day for housecleaning, either daily
(preferred) or at the end of your trip. Make sure you place the money
in such a way that they know you mean to give it, such as on an unmade
bed or with the free toiletries. While you can easily get away with
not tipping housecleaning, remember that you're in a privileged
position interviewing for these prestigious jobs and that these people
have to work very hard at less interesting work for less money.
Similarly, you should tip cab drivers at least 10-15%, more on
inexpensive trips. If your partner is with you and you're talking
about how rich the two of you will be, you have to tip more. Be sure
to always request a receipt and to record the total with tip. You
should also jot on it the date and some note that will help you
remember what trip it was for when you write up your expenses. If the
cab driver says he or she is out of receipts, make your own receipt on
a piece of notebook paper and get their signature.</p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p>You will typically be met at your hotel in the morning by a
faculty
member, around 8:30 if you're just getting a ride, earlier if you're
having breakfast together. Your day will be filled with meetings of
30-45 minutes with professors and usually one or two meetings with a
dean, provost, or president. You may or may not meet with students,
possibly en masse. Of course, you'll give a talk on your research or,
at
an undergraduate institution, teach a class; some schools have you do
both. You will have lunch and
dinner with people from the department. The rest of this section
discusses some general principles, such as attitude, and specific
activities in more detail.</p>
<h4>Attitude</h4>
<p>In the preparation phase, it is good to be a perfectionist.
Not
in the interview phase. If something goes wrong, accept it. If
you're late to the university, whether through your own fault or
circumstances beyond your control, stay calm. You'll get there
eventually, and getting stressed out won't help. If you appear in
casual clothes because your luggage has gotten lost, apologize to each
person you meet with
and to your audience, letting them know in one sentence what happened,
then proceed confidently.
What's less important than actually wearing the formal clothes is
communicating that you sincerely tried to. While you can be a
maverick in your research, don't flout convention unnecessarily in
other areas.</p>
<p>You should always appear confident, making sure that you know
the
difference between confidence and arrogance. Even at schools famous
for their arrogance, they do not like arrogant visitors. Here are
some sample exchanges:</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>"Why did you do X in
such-and-such a manner?"<br>
<b>Bad answer:</b> "Uh."<br>
<b>Confident answer:</b> "For reasons A, B, and C...
Although if I'd realized when I'd started that Y, I would have
considered Z instead. I'd definitely have used Z if I had more memory."<br>
<b>Arrogant answer:</b> "Any other approach would be really
stupid."</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> "Your thesis seems like it's just
a hack."<br>
<b>Bad answer:</b> "Uh."<br>
<b>Confident answer:</b> "I don't think it's a hack. The
way I see it is blah blah blah. It is true, however, that it's less
theoretical than some of the work that's been done, such as
So-and-So's. Let me describe some research I'm planning to do on top of
this (or that I did for my Master's thesis)."<br>
<b>Arrogant answer:</b> "No, this isn't just a hack. It's
the most important thesis in architecture in recent years."</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>"Are you aware of So-and-So's
related work on blah blah blah?"<br>
<b>Bad answer:</b> "Oh no! Uh-oh."<br>
<b>Confident answer:</b> "No I'm not. That sounds really
interesting. I'll look into it. Could you give me a reference? Thanks
for pointing me to it."<br>
<b>Arrogant answer:</b> "I don't know the work, so it must
not be relevant."</p>
<h4>Meetings with Faculty Members</h4>
<p>I felt that senior faculty members (those with tenure) used
meetings to judge me or to sell the department, while junior faculty,
who had recently been on the job market themselves, tried to put me at
ease and invited me to ask them questions about the department. A
question I asked all junior faculty was what hours they worked. I
ruled out one research university when a professor answered,
"This week I've been getting up at 6:30 [AM] and going home at 2 AM,
but this is an unusually tough week. Normally, I go home at 1
AM." Some other questions I liked to ask were:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the past few years, how many people have been denied
tenure?</li>
<li>Which colleges are most like yours? (This was helpful when
visiting a school I didn't have a feel for. Note that they'll usually
describe themselves as being comparable to a school that outsiders
consider better.)</li>
<li>What are the worst aspects of the school?</li>
<li>What's expected of a junior faculty member?</li>
<li>Where else did you consider working? Why did you choose
this school?</li>
<li>How is the department governed?</li>
<li>How much time to people spend on teaching?</li>
</ul>
<p>One professor at a school I visited told a story from his job
search about an exchange he had with a very senior professor:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Candidate:</strong> "I've heard that junior
faculty members here have no power, and the department is run in an
autocratic manner."<br>
<strong>Senior professor (angrily):</strong> "Who told
you that?"</blockquote>
<p>The candidate refused to answer the question, despite the
professor's insistence. Later in the discussion, the professor
untensed, smiled, and said, "I've figured out who must have told you
that." The candidate wisely concluded that this was a department
to avoid.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I noticed was that whenever I asked a
male
faculty member what percentage of the students in the department were
female, his off-the-top-of-his-head estimate was always much higher
than the actual number than I found out later from the person who had
the statistics. I'd be curious if other people have had the same
experience. I'm afraid I was a little undiplomatic on this subject.
When a professor told me that they'd been trying to get more female
students in the department, I had the temerity to ask what they were
trying, putting him in the awkward position of admitting that they
hadn't actually done anything.</p>
<p>Don't ask questions that you don't want the answer to. When I
met
with a female professor in another department of a school I visited and
discussed the
environment for women in the CS department, all of whose professors
were male, she told me that one of the professors (not the department
head) sometimes behaved offensively. I asked who, and she said she
was willing to answer but that I should first be sure that I really
wanted to know. Especially since it was a small department and I'd have
to
interact with everyone, I realized that no, I didn't want to know. I
soon found out anyway from a student who told about some crude
behavior in the classroom. At the end of the day, the department head
asked me if I had any advice on how to make the department more
hospitable to women. I don't know if it was politic, but I relayed
the story to him, without using any names. He was surprised by the
story and tried to get me to tell him who the professor was, which I
wouldn't. He indicated that it was the sort of behavior that he
didn't consider acceptable and would do something about if it was
brought to his attention, which was good for me to find out. </p>
<p>Some people will offer you something to drink or a bathroom
break.
If they don't and you want something, speak up. The same goes for
nonstandard requests, such as if you need a safety pin or to make a
phone call.</p>
<p>Especially after you've been on the road for a while, it can
be
hard to be enthusiastic for a meeting, particularly if you know
there's no way that you're going to work at this place. While the
primary purpose of interviewing is matching graduates with jobs, an
important secondary function is cross-pollenization. In your meetings,
you
can meet interesting people, find out about others' work, tell them
about work they might be interested in, pick up gossip about other
places you'll be visiting, and more. No meeting will be a waste of
time if you make the most of it.</p>
<p>Now might be a good place for a digression on <b>gossip</b>.
There's nothing wrong with gossiping; "gossip" (the noun)
just means "information". You don't need to say anything
unkind; in fact, you should say kind things whenever possible. My
host at one university only had positive things to say about everyone,
which made a good impression on me. My advice would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen a lot more than you talk.</li>
<li>When you have something good to say about someone, say it.</li>
<li>If you have something bad to say, only do so if there's a
good
reason and, even then, tone it down, and don't let on if you're
enjoying telling it.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a compelling reason to say something negative
would
be if someone considering going to a school you're knowledgeable about
asks your advice. Here are some examples of syntactic sugar:</p>
<p><b>You mean:</b> "Almost everyone in Prof. V's
group quit in disgust last year."<b><br>
You say: </b>"I know that there are some students who had
problems with Prof. V, but I don't know all the details."</p>
<p><b>You mean: </b>"Prof. W is racist and sexist."<b><br>
You say: </b>"Some people feel that Prof. W is most comfortable
with white men, but I don't know if that's true."</p>
<p><b>You mean: </b>"People expect Prof. X to be
denied tenure in a few years."<b><br>
You say: </b>"I'd be concerned about working with Prof. X,
because he doesn't have tenure, and it's always something of a craps
shoot at Drofnats University."</p>
<p><b>You mean: </b>"Prof. Y appropriated one of his
student's thesis work for his start-up."<b><br>
You say: </b>"Prof. Y has a start-up, and there's been some
concern about the independence of it and his research group."</p>
<p><b>You mean: </b>"I can't think of anything good
to say about Prof. Z, and none of the charges have been proven."<b><br>
You say: </b>"I really don't know much about Prof. Z; I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Some of the most useful gossip I got was when people had
worked
somewhere I was considering. For example, I found out that one
department
I was visiting had denied tenure to the overwhelming majority of their
faculty since its founding.</p>
<p>The juiciest gossip I received about people's home
institutions was
from students, who haven't yet learned to be discreet. One professor
told me that there were two professors in the department who didn't
get along but didn't say who they were; an undergraduate volunteered
that information cheerfully, along with further details. I tended to
get the most honest evaluations from students I struck up
conversations with myself, although sometimes the department's
hand-picked ones gave very useful information. One student I started
talking with in a lab (a great place to hang out) at
"Bayside" told me that his (former) advisor had been fired
and was suing the university. A quick web search revealed that the
school was under censure from the <a href="http://www.aaup.org/aaup">American
Association of University
Professors</a>, a troubling sign.</p>
<p>Another very good way to learn about a school is reading
current
and past issues of its student newspaper. My host at Bayside deterred
me from picking up the current issue when I was walking with him. I
picked one up later and discovered that the front-page story was about
a letter protesting the treatment of professors signed by <i>all</i>
of the faculty members. Papers are sometimes accessible online, or
you can also visit the newspaper office to read back issues
or telephone to mail-order them.</p>
<p>To get the most out of your trip, keep a <strong>journal</strong>,
preferably
online, into which you transcribe and expand upon your notes from each
day. As Mark Twain wrote, "A journal properly kept is worth a
thousand dollars <i>when you've got it done</i>."
Unfortunately,
as Twain discusses in <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new?id=TwaInno&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=4&amp;division=div">chapter
4</a> of the appropriately-titled <cite><a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/innocent/iahompag.html">Innocents
Abroad</a></cite>, many journals get
started with the best of intentions, and few get finished. I must
confess that I am one of those delinquents. I went from writing a
page about each place, which I shared with friends who asked to be
kept posted on my progress, to writing nothing. Here are a few
entries, containing both personal and technical information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first interview was at Mills College on Tuesday, Feb.
18.... I met
with the two tenure-track CS faculty members, Susan Wang and Matthew
Merzbacher. Susan got her SB from MIT around 1985. She's about to come
up for tenure, and no problems are expected. At lunch, she asked me
how I would supervise compiler/architecture research, and I said I'd
get back to her. I had heard about Matt from Franklyn Turbak and Sean
Sandys. Franklyn knew Matt from Wellesley and Sean from Williams, both
places where Matt has taught. He's very nice and was a warm host,
showing me around the campus and taking me to his duplex in Faculty
Village, where he lives with his wife, who is pregnant....</p>
<p>[Note the degradation in notes quality at this later
interview:] ....The other group I was being considered for was user
interfaces. Dr. T was out of town, so I met with Dr. C and Dr. H. Both
of those meetings went well, although my meeting with Dr. J, their
boss, did not. It was my last meeting of the day, I was
sleep-deprived, and I felt as though she wasn't treating my ideas with
respect. Dr. K demoed his X system to me, and I showed him the Y
system and
suggested he see about getting their code. My meeting with Dr. P (AI)
went poorly. Dr. F started by criticizing my research a lot, but
things went better after I acknowledged its limitations and started
taking notes on his leads: deductive databases, XSB at SUNY Stony
Brook, U Wisc Madison, Ramakrishnan COREL?, Jeff Ulman's group at
Stanford, Alon Levy. I had a pleasant meeting with Dr. F and
Dr. S. They suggested I look at Datalog, which I could read about in
Ulman's database book or in Vianu _Database Systems_ Abiteboul? They
reminded me of the Z work by Prof. A, although they appeared not to
have that high an opinion of it. The person I met with next (not clear
from my notes) knows Lynn [my advisor] and suggested that users care a
lot about response time; I agreed, also thinking that I should add
user time to my measures. This person told me that Datalog differed
from Prolog in having no functors, being bottom-up, and being
decidable. Dr. M suggested that I look into the Verity more-like-this
feature and showed me their experimental web site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I had a set of notes that included all the places I
visited.
Try to do a better job than I did.&nbsp; At the very least, save
the schedules of everywhere
you visited so you know who you met with. Mark any changes on the
written schedule throughout the day.</p>
<h4>Meeting with Administrators</h4>
<p>Meetings with administrators ranged from low-pressure chats to
a high-pressure simultaneous grilling by a president and
provost on where I was likely to get research funds. In general, you
should let the administrator take the lead. Sometimes, the professor
walking you to the meeting will have told you what the administrator
wants to hear, such as when I was told, "He'll want to hear how much
money you'll be able to raise."</p>
<p>While you should get guidance from your hosts, be sure to
distinguish
between their interests and yours. One search chair told me that the
provost didn't appreciate how much a computer science professor needed
to be paid and that I should tell her I'd require a lot of money. I
didn't say anything on the subject. That was the search committee's
job, not mine, or for after I'd gotten the offer. At another
institute, after the first day of interviews, I told my host that it
was a bad match and that I definitely did not want the job. He told
me to meet with the president the next day anyway, not telling her of
my negative decision, so as not to "hurt her feelings". I'm sure the
real reason was that he didn't want the president to find out that the
search committee had flown in someone so ill-suited to the
position. In any case, I agreed not to tell her of my
conclusion. (As it happened, a freak blizzard intervened, and the
school closed down the second day.)</p>
<p>I liked to ask administrators whether any women who became a
mother
while on the tenure-track had gotten tenure. When no data was
available on that, I would sometimes ask about the retention of female
faculty. Of course, nobody told me that I couldn't get tenure if I
had a baby. One president said, "I don't see why that would be a
problem. That's just three months out of six years." (Presumably, he
would have told a prospective father that it's just fifteen minutes.)
While it's good to ask administrators questions, you should take
their answers with a grain of salt. For example, it's fun to ask
administrators how important teaching is ("very important") and to
report the answer back to professors, giving them a good laugh.</p>
<p>My most interesting discussion with a provost was at a school
that I'll refer to at Oswego. Because I had decided from that day's
prior
meetings that I didn't want to work there, I talked turkey with him,
and he reciprocated. Specifically, I told him why the position was
less attractive than other ones I'd seen, that there were a lot of
positions open that year, and what he could do to make the offer more
attractive. He listened appreciatively to what I said, concurring and
volunteering further information.
I asked him how Oswego compared to nearby Bayside (where I had been
told that the two schools were equal). He gave a very interesting
and honest answer: "Let me put it this way: Their professors
graduated from here, while our professors graduated from better
schools."</p>
<h4>Giving Your Talk</h4>
<p>There are plenty of other places where you can get advice on
job
talks. I'll just repeat a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a friendly-looking person in the audience to look at
frequently. It's better for your morale to look at smiling than
scowling faces.</li>
<li>Take a drink of water when someone asks a question. Not
only is
it a free moment, but it keeps you from looking as through you might
be about to interrupt. </li>
<li>Deflect less relevant questions with "Let's discuss that
off-line."</li>
<li>The talk is important not just for showing your research
but also
for showing your teaching ability.</li>
<li>Wear a watch, even if you don't usually, because there
might not be a clock in sight. &nbsp;I was once mortified to find
out that I'd spoken for over an hour when I was supposed to give a
50-minute talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you interview at both research universities and
primarily-undergraduate institutions, you may have to develop multiple
talks, or at least adjust them for different audiences. When I was
invited to interview at Mills, I was asked to guest lecture a class.
Since I wanted to visit Mills before my imminent East Coast tour and
didn't have time to prepare a new lecture, I asked if I could give a
talk I had ready that was appropriate to undergraduates and said that,
if I passed that first round, I'd come back and lecture a course
later, without their having to pay any additional expenses (mostly
picked up by other Bay Area employers). They agreed.</p>
<p>When I came back, I taught a computer architecture class
attended by
six students (Mills has small classes) and most of the
department's faculty members (about the same number). I knew from the
start that my blackboard technique was atrocious. (I had no classroom
experience.) A student challenged a statement I made and I wasn't
able to come up with an answer for what seemed like tens of seconds.
I felt the class was going so badly that I was seriously tempted to
stop and give up in the middle. I persevered and, to my surprise,
was told after the class that I'd done well and later received a job
offer. I think what saved me was having done the following things
right:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had been told ahead of time that the class would be
small, so I had prepared a worksheet and called on the students
round-robin fashion to answer questions. It turns out the other
contenders just lectured to the six students for 75 minutes.</li>
<li>When I didn't immediately know the answer to that question,
I admitted it instead of trying to bluff.</li>
<li>I had already told the faculty that I knew my classroom
skills
were weak, due to inexperience, and that I looked forward to improving
them. In response, I had been asked if I'd be willing to team-teach a
course with a more experienced professor, and I answered (honestly)
that I thought that would be great.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Meals</h3>
<p>Meal times give you a good opportunity to see how people in
the
department interact with each other. I was turned off when faculty
members casually insulted each other over lunch at one school. At
another school, a male professor member kept touching the female
faculty members more than I'd want to be touched by any colleague but
Keith.</p>
<p>I would often be asked by the host what type of food I liked
(in
order to help choose a restaurant). I either named a local
specialty, asked for some options, or left the decision entirely to
my host. While I think a vegetarian could be accommodated
at the last minute, someone who observes a vegan or kosher diet
might want to give advance warning.</p>
<p>At lunch, I avoided heavy foods, to keep from getting sleepy,
often choosing sandwiches. If others had dessert or coffee, I
requested fruit or herbal tea so as to have something. At dinner, I
went all out, as did the other attendees, who see these meals as a
junket. The host usually asked me before ordering if I would like wine.
I always
said "no", since I don't drink, and added, "but don't let me stop
you". This is also how I would recommend turning down dessert (not an
issue for me).</p>
<p>The bad part about these dinners it that I was always
exhausted
before they were over. As socializing continued after dessert and
coffee, I sometimes resorted to hints, such as visibly yawning or
asking what time my first meeting the next day was, although these had
little effect.</p>
<h3>Manners</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you'll meet up with someone who doesn't know how
to
behave professionally toward women. One candidate was at a dinner
where an older professor cheerfully praised her looks and said that,
consequently, he was for hiring her. While some people would advocate
telling the professor off, I'd recommend ignoring the remark, accepting
it in the spirit it was attended, or saying
something like: "If you think I look good now, wait until you see my
thesis results." I know it's lame, but at least it calls attention
back to what is important. For guidance in this sort of situation and
elsewhere, I highly recommend <cite>Ms. Mentor's
Impeccable Advice for Women in Academia</cite>, by Emily Toth.</p>
<p>I'll take this opportunity for a digression on
<strong>etiquette</strong>. The main rule of interaction is
deceptively simple: A lower-status person defers to a higher-status
person. What's tricky is how status is determined and what sort of
deference is expected. Here are the basic rules for determining status:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A guest has higher status than a host.
</li>
<li> A woman has (nominally) higher status than a man <em>in
social
situations</em>, as does an older person over a younger person.
</li>
<li> A higher-ranked person has higher status than a
lower-ranked
person.
</li>
</ul>
Some ways that someone defers are:
<ul>
<li> Letting the other person choose whether to shake hands.
</li>
<li> Allowing the higher-status person to pass through a door

Note that gender is not supposed to matter in professional situations.
At a crowded talk, it would be polite (but not required) for a female
graduate student to offer her chair to a male professor, as would be
true if the sexes were reversed. Years ago, I ran into Jaron Lanier
on an elevator on my way to hear him speak at the Media Lab. Even
though he's a big guy, and I was a petite young woman, he accepted my
offer to "help" him with his bags (showing the same graciousness as
the police officer Robert Fulghum wrote about, who, when arresting
topless protesters, included a flat-chested woman).<br>
<br>
[Later, as a professor, I was invited by the Provost to a small
reception in honor of a new assistant professor. &nbsp;Wanting some
water, I picked up the pitcher and looked around to see to whom I might
offer some before pouring my own. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the two
closest people were the Provost (highest rank) and the new assistant
professor (guest of honor). &nbsp;I didn't know who to serve first
and just stood there stupidly. &nbsp;Really, I should have just
offered it to either or both of them.]
<p>I think etiquette is most interesting when different people's
protocols conflict. For example, after finishing an elevator ride
with a senior professor at my home institution, I automatically waited
for him to
disembark first. Since he was raised with the rule that a gentleman
defers to a lady, even if he is a Turing Award winner (which he was)
and she a mere
graduate student, he likewise paused for me to get off first. Did I
insist on waiting him out or tell him off for being sexist
(considering my being female more significant than my being a grad
student)? Of course not. I got off the elevator and gave him a smile
and nod of thanks. Moral: Don't take offense when someone has the
best of intentions. In other words, respect diversity. This goes for
inappropriate but well-intentioned compliments too.</p>
<p>Anyway, as a guest, you will be treated as having higher
status
than people in the host department, whether you're male or female.
Professors will offer to carry your bags, and you should feel free to
accept, especially if you have multiple or heavy bags. Don't be
confused if few people offer to shake hands. If
they're following standard etiquette, they're waiting for you to
initiate the handshake. The only time on the interview circuit that I
didn't offer my hand was when I was introduced to a man who was
wearing a yarmulke (head-covering worn by Orthodox Jewish men).
Because many such men don't like to touch strange women, I didn't want
to put him in the situation of refusing a handshake or doing
something he was uncomfortable with. I discussed this with him later
(being Jewish myself),
and he said that while he does shake hands with women, he doesn't like
to be behind closed doors with a woman (besides his wife and
relatives), which has caused offense to a secretary in the
department. Just as we'd insist that a man respect a woman's sexual
modesties, we should respect men's.</p>
<p>There are people who will tell you that it's illegal to be
asked
personal questions, so it won't happen to you. These people are
ridiculously naive. As I suspect
any female job-seeker (and some males) can
tell you, they are asked. It's also not true that asking such
questions is illegal, in the sense that a court would impose a
punishment. What is illegal is discriminating on the basis of whether
someone is a parent, for example, whether the fact is determined
directly or indirectly. If a potential employer asks a candidate
whether she has children, she answers yes, and she does not get a job
offer, she would have to prove that it was her parental status that
caused them not to make an offer in order to have any legal rights.
Employers (nominally) avoid asking such questions, because their being
ignorant makes it trivial to argue that they didn't discriminate.</p>
<p>I was asked some inappropriate personal questions, sometimes
by top
administrators who should have known better, such as whether I had
children. Instead of refusing to answer or making a smart remark
("not that I know of"), I just answered honestly. (Asking whether I
had children was always a prelude to telling me what a good place the
area is for families.) I was surprised when a department head asked
if my fiancé would choose a job first and then I would choose a job
near
his. My answer: a simple "no". You may want to think ahead of time
about how you would answer likely personal questions.</p>
<h2>After Your Visits</h2>
<h3>Submitting receipts</h3>
<p>With each set of receipts, send a cover letter listing and
totaling the charges. Some employers insist on your social security
number, so
you may want to include that just in case. Save copies of the
receipts and cover letter. One prospective employer did need to be
prodded to pay up. If you haven't heard anything a month after
submitting receipts, send a friendly email asking if they need any
further information in order to reimburse you.</p>
<h3>Endgame</h3>
<p>My first offer was from Mills, which gave me a two-week
response
time. Because it is in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many of
Keith's top choices were, we were optimistic that we could find a
two-body solution, although he had not yet interviewed in the Bay
Area. I explained the situation to Mills and expressed my strong
interest in the position, beginning to negotiate a contract. They had
offered to let me start in January and to give me a reduced teaching
load my first semester. The ordinary load is 5 courses per year (two
semesters), so I would have "only" had to teach 2 courses my first
semester. A friend at another school pointed out to me that the
benefit was less than the usual one-year reduction, so I requested and
was granted a reduced load for my first three semesters (2 courses per
semester). Because I was starting mid-year, the original contract
given to me by Mills was ambiguous about when I would come up for
tenure. I asked for and received a statement that it would be my
choice whether to be reviewed for tenure after five-and-a-half or
six-and-a-half years. I asked for more money in salary (even though
the offer was higher than I expected) but did not receive it. [I did
get a raise not long after arriving at Mills when most faculty salaries
were adjusted to market rates. &nbsp;I like to think I was included
because I raised the issue.] &nbsp;I
discussed equipment needs, both technical and ergonomic, and was
assured they would be filled, although no dollar amount was specified
in my contract. Because of the commercial possibilities for my
research (information retrieval from the Internet), I asked for and,
to my surprise, received a written statement that I would retain all
rights to intellectual property I create, including copyright and
patents, even if I created the work on Mills equipment. </p>
<p>Keith and I continued interviewing as scheduled, letting
potential
employers know about the Mills deadline and that we needed an offer as
soon as possible. One Bay Area research lab made me an offer within a
day or two of my interview. I also contacted an attractive college
and research lab I had interviewed at earlier to ask for an expedited
decision. Both told me they would not be making me offers, which was
disappointing but not devastating. One of the places had offered
their faculty position to someone I too considered more qualified, and
the research lab did not hire anyone that year (although I don't think
they thought me stellar in any case). &nbsp;[I'll admit to some
schadenfreude when the professor who got the faculty position I applied
for up and left the institution, presumably making them wish they'd
chosen someone less flighty.]</p>
<p>By the end of my two-week grace time from Mills, Keith had an
oral
but not written offer from one of his top-choice employers, NASA Ames,
in Mountain View. Since Keith and I were both in the Bay Area (him
for interviews, me for a conference), we visited Mills, in order to
strongly convey my interest even though I wasn't ready to sign. This
also gave me a chance to see my proposed co-workers again and for
Keith to meet them. I was granted another week, during which time
Keith received a written offer from another attractive Bay Area
company, and I orally accepted the Mills offer and withdrew my other
applications. The paperwork for both NASA and Mills took a few
weeks
to complete. </p>
<p>To recap the statistics, my 100+ applications netted me about
25
invitations to interview, of which I accepted about half. As
discussed above, I received two offers and two rejections before
withdrawing my applications. Keith received three offers, all from
research labs, before withdrawing his applications. We're glad the
job search is over and feel very fortunate to have found a two-body
solution.</p>

<h2><a name="Afterword"></a>Afterword</h2>
Mills was a good choice for me and not just geographically. &nbsp;I
taught small classes of earnest students and worked among a dedicated
and talented faculty. &nbsp;Teaching turned out to be harder than I
had realized it would be. &nbsp;My first semester, in which I
taught two courses, I worked harder than ever before in my life,
including as an undergraduate at MIT. &nbsp;Planning a 200-guest
wedding, which I did concurrently, was nearly effortless by comparison.
&nbsp;My second semester was easier, since I got a course release
for participating in an educational seminar, and a senior professor
co-taught my one course with me to help me improve my teaching.
&nbsp;Also in my second semester, I was awarded a NSF Career grant,
which provided funds for research and allowed me to buy down my
teaching load so I never had to teach more than two courses per
semester, which I am not sure I could do well. &nbsp;Later, the
Provost agreed to give mathematics and computer science faculty
teaching credit for the previously uncredited labs and recitation
sections, reducing all of our loads to two courses per semester.
&nbsp;I earned tenure in five-and-a-half years, in spring 2003.
&nbsp;I spent my sabbatical year (calendar 2004) at Google, after
which I returned to Mills with a better understanding of the skills
needed for industry, and kept working at Google part-time.
&nbsp;After a stressful period serving as department chair
2005-2007 and during a computer science enrollment downturn, I took a
two-year leave from Mills to work full-time at Google, where I am now
(February 2009).<br>
<br>
Looking back at my essay, I am amazed how many positions were available
when I did my search. &nbsp;I could not have gone on the market at
a better time: during the dot-com boom, when CS departments were
expanding and professors (and new PhDs) were going into industry. After
the dot-com bust, CS enrollment -- and faculty hiring -- plummeted.
&nbsp;In 2008, most college and university endowments fell around
30%, causing some schools to cancel searches or institute hiring
freezes.<br>
<br>
I gained a different perspective on hiring participating in many search
committees at Mills, mostly in mathematics or computer science.
&nbsp;I experienced from the other side trying to gauge candidates'
level of interest in Mills, both in deciding whom to interview and to
whom to make an offer. &nbsp;One mathematics candidate with
outstanding research experience and strong teaching experience insisted
that he really wanted to be at a liberal arts college. &nbsp;We
offered him a faculty position over some other excellent candidates,
which he accepted. &nbsp;A few months later, he changed his mind
and decided he really wanted to be at a research university.
&nbsp;We were devastated. &nbsp;It was too late to get any of
the other candidates, and we ended up losing that tenure line.<br>
<br>
We received far more applicants for mathematics positions than computer
science, perhaps because computer science PhDs have many attractive
industry options. &nbsp;On the math side, it was rare for us to
invite a candidate without teaching awards to interview, while it was
typical to invite computer scientists without teaching experience (as
they did with me). &nbsp;Some mistakes candidates made in their
applications:<br>
<ul>
<li>Praising the high quality of our graduate program (when we
didn't have one).</li>
<li>Plagiarizing the teaching statement of another candidate.</li>
<li>My favorite: Addressing a letter to a women's college "Dear
Sir".</li>
</ul>
I will repeat my advice to customize applications for schools that you
care about and to let committees know if you'll be in the geographic
area so they can either formally or informally interview you when they
might not have chosen to spend their limited funds flying you in sight
unseen.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
