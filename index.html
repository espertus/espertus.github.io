				    I have a great job, but the future of Mills is uncertain, so I'm looking around for other opportunities. Below are some of the highlights of my career to provide an idea of my passions and capabilities. See also my <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a> and <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I would like to remain in San Francisco and am interested in both teaching and developer positions. I am committed to remaining at Mills through May 2022.

							  In January 1998, I joined the faculty of Mills, a minority-serving women's college in Oakland, California, where I have been able to combine my love of computer science, passion for teaching, and my commitment to social justice. Sadly, Mills will be closing for financial reasons.
