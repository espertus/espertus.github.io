Dear Ms. Spertus,

Thank you for your email.  I apologize for the late response.  

<font color=red>Please know that this particular email was knowingly sent out to 
all customers who elected not to opt in during sign-up.</font>  As said
in the email, many of our customers who originally opted not to
receive the occasional email from us changed their preference.
This email is a one-time only announcement, and was in no way intended
to be obnoxious.

We apologize if you were in fact offended by the email, and hope you will
not let it affect your views of our company.  Please feel free to get back
to me with any further concerns.

Sincerely,

John Tsui
