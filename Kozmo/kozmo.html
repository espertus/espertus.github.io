<h2>Background</h2> 

<p>In November, I received <a href="kozmo1.html">email</a> from <a
href="http://www.kozmo.com">Kozmo.com</a> that stated that it was
being sent to people who had NOT opted in to receive announcements.
My complaint to <a
href="mailto:privacy@kozmo.com">privacy@kozmo.com</a> (the address
listed on their <a
href="https://www.kozmo.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/abo/privacy_policy.d2w/report?MERCHANT_RN=5">website</a>)
bounced.  A message I sent to customer service was replied to with the
<a href="kozmo2.html">statement</a> that the message was not sent in error; they were
intentionally mailing people who had not opted in.  At this point, I
sent a registered letter to Kozmo, asking for (1) an apology, (2) $250, and (3) assurance that this would not happen again.
I said
that, if I did not receive these, that I would file suit and expected
to win under <a href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/index.shtml">California law</a>.  I was not able to get the names of Kozmo
officers from the website or by phone, so I addressed my letter to
Christopher Shimojima, who was listed in a magazine article as being
the VP for customer service.  I received the return receipt but no
reply.  I sent a second letter, which was not replied to in a timely
manner.</p>

<p>I filed suit in <a
href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/trial/smallclaims/">California
Small Claims Court</a> for $500 against Kozmo.com for violating our
agreement and sections <a
href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/bpc_17538-45.shtml">17538.45</a>
and <a
href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/bpc_17538-4.shtml">17538.4</a> of
the California Business and Professions Code.  I had the SF courts
serve papers on Kozmo by registered mail.  I paid $27.50 in filing fees.
A court date was scheduled for Wednesday, April 4.</p>

<p>Eventually, I did get a response from Kozmo to my letters.
Specifically, a message was left on voicemail denying any wrongdoing
but offering me "ten Kozmo dollars".  I did not return the message.</p>

<h2>Hearing: April 4, 2001</h2>

<p>I prepared for the hearing by printing all relevant documents in
duplicate and highlighting key sections.  I tried emailing
<a href="mailto:privacy@kozmo.com">privacy@kozmo.com</a>, still listed in the <a href="https://www.kozmo.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/abo/privacy_policy.d2w/report?MERCHANT_RN=5">privacy policy</a>, to see if it
worked and got another bounce.  I made a printout of the privacy
statement and the two bounces.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the court session, the clerk determined who was in
attendance, at which point I found out that Kozmo had sent a
representative.  The clerk informed us that we needed to share any
exhibits with the opposing side, so I gave copies of my documents to
the Kozmo rep.  (I had only made two sets of documents, one for me and
one for the judge.  I should have brought three copies.)  Two other
cases were heard before mine, both of which ended with the judge
saying she would mail her ruling in 1-2 weeks.  (The other cases
involved a car towing and an injury at a Safeway grocery store,
apparently due to slipping on chicken grease.)</p>

<p>The judge first asked me to state my side of the case, which I did, as
above.  I also pointed out that in addition to being the recipient of
the email, the mail was routed through a machine that I own with my
husband, which may make me qualify as an electronic mail service
provider under California Business and Professions Code <a href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/bpc_17538-45.shtml">17538.45</a>.
(The spam was sent to yap-ers@spertus.com, then forwarded to
spertus@mills.edu.)</p>


<p>The judge than asked the Kozmo rep to tell her version of the story.  She claimed that the mail was not unsolicited commercial email because:
<ol>
<li> I had an existing business relationship with Kozmo.  (This is a reference to paragraph a2A of 17538.45.)
<li> It was not an advertisement; it was a service announcement letting customers know that they could opt in.
</ol>
Furthermore, she said:
<ol>
<li value=3>It was only a single message, not multiple messages.
<li> Section 17538.45 applies to electronic mail service providers, which would not apply in this case.
<li> <a href="https://www.kozmo.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/abo/privacy_policy.d2w/report?MERCHANT_RN=5">Kozmo's privacy statement</a> only promises not to share our email address, not to avoid sending us unwanted email.
</ol>
</p>

<p>When it was my turn again, I responded to the points:
<ol>
<li value=1> Confirming that, yes, I did have a business relationship with Kozmo.  (It seems like good manners and good policy to express agreement when the opponent says something with which I can agree.)
<li value=2> Arguing that <a href="kozmo1.html">the message</a> was not just an announcement.  Its second paragraph, which I showed the judge, announced new services.  
<li value=4> I said that I do not know if I qualify as an electronic mail service provider, but that my husband and I do serve several domain names on our computer and forward email for about a dozen people.
</ol>
I did not respond to points 3 and 5.
</p>

<p>During the wind-up phase, the Kozmo rep said that I had not received a
timely response from Kozmo because I had sent my complaint letter to
someone who was no longer at the company, having left the previous
summer.  I said that I had not been able to get the names of the
officers from the website or by telephone but had gotten it from an
article about Kozmo from that summer.</p>


<p>The judge asked us for any documents we wished her to consider.  I
gave her the above-mentioned documents, plus a few articles about
successful suits against spammers.  As with the other cases, she told
us to expect the decision to be mailed next week or the following one.
I will update this site when I receive it.</p>

<a name=judgment><h2>Judgment</h2></a>

<p>On April 17, I received this <a href="judgment.gif">judgment</a> that I won my case.  I was awarded $50 principal plus $27.50 in court costs.  I believe this is the first case of its kind in California.  I am very pleased.</p>
