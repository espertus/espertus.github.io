would like to change their preference.  Now, you can opt-in to our
subscriber contact list via the Web site -- http://www.kozmo.com -- by

You also may not have heard about a new service at kozmo.com that
revolutionizes gift giving.  When you first joined kozmo.com, you
could have products delivered to your door in under an hour.  Now you
can use our new gifting feature to have any item on the site delivered
as a gift to anyone in our service areas in 11 cities across the
country.* Every item we carry -- from DVDs to MP3 players, diapers to
baby blankets, gourmet chocolates to martini glasses -- can be sent as
a gift.  We can deliver your gift in our new signature orange box with
a personal greeting.  We’ll even deliver gifts on Christmas Day!

You can also subscribe to our e-mail updates by replying to this
e-mail and typing OPT-IN.

Happy holidays and thank you for choosing kozmo.com.
