<H1>CALIFORNIA COURT RULES AGAINST KOZMO IN GROUNDBREAKING ANTI-SPAM CASE</H1>

<p>(San Francisco, CA-Apr. 22, 2001) On April 16, 2001, the Small Claims Division of the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco released a <a href="judgment.gif">ruling</a> against Kozmo under California state laws regulating unsolicited commercial email (UCE), commonly known as "spam."</p>

<p>The court awarded Ellen Spertus, the plaintiff, $50 principal and $27.50 in court costs in what Spertus called a "moral victory."  Spertus sued under Sections <a
href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/bpc_17538-45.shtml">17538.45</a>
and <a
href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/bpc_17538-4.shtml">17538.4</a> of the California Business and Professions Code, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1999.</p>

<p>Spertus said that she has received thousands of pieces of spam over the years but that the <a href="kozmo1.html">November 23 mailing</a> from Kozmo "pushed her over the edge".  The mailing began by acknowledging that it was being sent to customers "who originally opted not to receive occasional e-mail news from us".  When Spertus complained to the address provided for privacy concerns on the Kozmo.com site, the message was returned as undeliverable. Kozmo ignored a subsequent letter of complaint, at which time Spertus filed suit.</p>

<p>The hearing was held in San Francisco on April 4, 2001.  Spertus argued that the Kozmo mailing violated <a
href="http://www.suespammers.org/ca/bpc_17538-4.shtml">Section 17538.4</a>, which states, "Upon notification by a recipient of his or her request not to receive any further unsolicited faxed or e-mailed documents, no person or entity conducting business in this state shall fax or cause to be faxed or e-mail or cause to be e-mailed any unsolicited documents to that recipient."</p>

<p>Spertus, a computer science professor at Mills College in Oakland, California, learned of the opportunity for action against UCE through <a href="http://www.suespammers.org">suespammers.org</a>.</p>

<p>Spertus said that she does not expect to collect from Kozmo, which went out of business on April 11, 2001.  "It is still a victory.  My goal was to send a message to companies that they cannot disregard users' 'opt-out' requests and to let individuals know that they can fight back.  It was never about the money."  Spertus went on to joke: "If money were my primary motivator, I wouldn't have become a college professor.  I am just grateful that the judge didn't award me the company."  </p>

<p>Spertus vs. Kozmo.com is San Francisco Small Claims Case #789335.
